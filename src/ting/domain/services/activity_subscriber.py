        cluster's task — once the recorded backoff delay has elapsed — with
        a freshly resolved adapter. That is what picks up a rotated PAT or a
        changed Guild ``base_url`` instead of retrying forever against a
        stale one, and it never touches another cluster's task (see
        .claude/rules/no-fallbacks.md — a stale credential must not keep
        being silently retried against the wrong target). A clean stream end
        (no error) also just returns; the next sync cycle reconnects it at
        the ordinary ``reconnect_delay`` cadence.

        Guards against double-handling events from an orphaned task: before
        starting, and before handling each event, this checks that it is
        still the task ``_owner_tasks`` has recorded for its ``(owner,
        key)`` — if sync has since rebuilt this cluster under a different
        task, this one stops silently instead of also processing events.

        A cluster that legitimately has no sessions right now never gets
        the "first event" backoff reset below — if it then drops mid-stream
        (raises instead of closing cleanly) before ever sending an event,
        that reset never fires either. So the connection's own age is also
        a health signal: ``volundr.subscribe_activity()`` yields
        ``ActivityStreamConnected`` exactly once, as soon as the connection
        is genuinely open (not merely "we started trying"), and one that
        has stayed open at least ``reconnect_stable_after_seconds`` since
        then still counts as a recovery even though it ends in an
        exception. The clock starts there, never at task start — a connect
        that hangs to its own timeout (which can be the same order of
        magnitude as the stability window) must never be credited as
        "connected", or the backoff would never grow for a cluster that
