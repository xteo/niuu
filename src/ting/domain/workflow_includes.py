"""Resolve ``kind: include`` nodes into the parent graph that names them.

An ``include`` node names another pinned workflow declared in this document's
own ``workflow_dependencies`` and a mapping of the included graph's node ids
to the local ids they take in this graph. Resolution copies each named node,
and every edge of the included graph whose source *and* target are both
named, into the parent graph under their local ids, then removes the include
node itself. Everything about a copied node other than its id, and the
presentational ``position``/``label`` an include may override, is taken
verbatim from the included document — that document remains the single
source of truth for the stage or gate it defines.

This is a shared-definition mechanism, not dispatch: the copied nodes run
inline in whatever session runs the parent graph, exactly like a hand-written
stage. A ``subworkflow`` node remains the only way to run a child workflow as
a separate session.

Resolution itself needs no I/O beyond the caller-supplied ``resolve_alias``
callback, which returns the exact pinned document a ``workflow_dependencies``
alias names. Callers that already hold a validated pinned-dependency closure
(a bundled workflow's own transitive definitions, a launch snapshot's frozen
``workflow_definitions``, or an authoring save that already resolved its
pins) build that resolver with ``include_resolver_from_workflow_definitions``
instead of making a second catalog lookup.
