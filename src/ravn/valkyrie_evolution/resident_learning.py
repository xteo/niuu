        venv here — with the tool's declared requirements installed — before

        keeps working). A non-tool skill proposal without test_code keeps the
        canary-only path: old markdown-skill proposals are weaker evidence,

        it once installed (there is nothing to have verified it with), so
        installing it would just be a capability the peer can see but never
        call; it is declined here instead. Self-built artifacts were already
        verified (and repaired) by build_tool.

        rejection when re-verification did not clear (missing test_code for
        an agent_tool, or verification actually ran and failed), else
