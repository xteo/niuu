            Called remotely by a Kubernetes-backed session pod's

            browser, and only registered at all when this deployment is
            configured for remote room-role resolution (``room_role_source
            == "remote"``; see ``PodManagerConfig.room_role_source``).

            Authorization is intentionally stricter than every other route on
            this router:

            1. The bearer token must be a scoped workload credential
               (``scoped_credential_claims`` — ``token_use ==
               "valkyrie_build"``) carrying the ``forge:session:room-role``
               scope. An ordinary human JWT or unscoped PAT is refused
               outright: this endpoint discloses "does user X have role Y on
               session Z", which nothing but this session's own pod should
               ever be able to ask.
            2. The credential's ``workload_sub`` claim (the K8s
               ServiceAccount subject baked into the exchanged token by
               ``WorkloadIdentityService.issue_token`` — see
               ``niuu.domain.services.workload_identity``) must name THIS
               session: session pods use the ``openbao-session-{id}``
               service account (``OpenBaoAgentInjectionAdapter
               ._service_account_name``), so a token minted for session A's
               pod can never be used to probe session B's participants.

            ``user_id``/``tenant_id``/``roles`` name the TARGET principal
            whose role is being asked about — already verified upstream by
            that pod's Envoy JWT filter into the x-auth-* headers it
            forwards, but re-derived through Forge's own identity adapter
            (``_resolve_target_principal``) so IdP-raw roles (e.g.
            "developer") map to Cedar's expected "volundr:developer" the
            SAME way every other entry point maps them — an unmapped
            Principal here would demote every owner to 403, the exact class
            of incident this project has already hit once.

            Read-only: no state changes. Returns ``{"role": None}`` rather
            than 403/404 when the target has no active grant, matching
            ``effective_room_role``'s "no role" answer — this is what lets
            the remote adapter fail closed on transport/auth errors while
            still treating "no grant" as its own, distinct, expected outcome.

            ``scoped_credential_claims``/``require_scope`` deliberately
            decode the bearer token WITHOUT verifying its signature (see
            ``token_scope._decode_claims``'s docstring: "Signature
            verification is delegated to Envoy upstream"). That is safe only
            once something in-process has already verified the token —
            which is exactly what ``extract_principal`` does (the SAME
            dependency every other route on this router uses). Calling it
            FIRST, and discarding only what it returns, is what stops an
            unsigned or wrongly-signed forged
            ``{token_use: valkyrie_build, scopes: [...], workload_sub: ...}``
