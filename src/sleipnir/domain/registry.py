"""Sleipnir event type constants.

All event types are defined here as module-level constants to avoid magic
strings throughout the codebase. Import the constant, not the string literal.

Organised by namespace:

- ``RAVN_*`` — Ravn agent events
- ``TING_*``  — Ting autonomous dispatcher events
- ``VOLUNDR_*`` — Volundr platform events
- ``BIFROST_*`` — Bifrost gateway events
- ``SYSTEM_*`` — Infrastructure and lifecycle events
- ``ENVIRONMENT_*`` — Resident Environment lifecycle/state events
- ``SIGNAL_*`` — Normalized Environment signals
- ``VALKYRIE_*`` — Resident Valkyrie state, judgment, and action events
- ``ODIN_*`` — ODIN court decisions
- ``ATTENTION_*`` — Attention routing/escalation events
- ``FEEDBACK_*`` — Feedback on signals, state, judgments, and actions
- ``LEARNING_*`` — Learning promotion and adoption events
- ``PARTICIPANT_*`` — Presence for agents, humans, tools, and surfaces
- ``ROOM_*`` — Huddle/room lifecycle and transcript events
