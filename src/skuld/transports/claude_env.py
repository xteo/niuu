"""Shared spawn-env construction for the Claude CLI/SDK transports.

Default auth = the host's claude.ai subscription (the OAuth login in
``~/.claude``), exactly like an interactive ``claude`` shell: the
platform-injected ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` / ``ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`` are STRIPPED
from the child env so the CLI falls back to the stored login. Rationale: the
deploy env's API key belongs to an org without data retention enabled, which
400s on retention-gated models (``claude-fable-5``) that the same host's
subscription login can use.

Set ``SKULD__CLAUDE_AUTH=api_key`` to restore API-key billing (the key vars are
kept). ``CLAUDECODE`` is always dropped — a nested-session marker that breaks
the spawned CLI.

With a model gateway (``gateway_url``), the CLI is pointed at it instead of
api.anthropic.com: ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` + ``ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN``, and the
platform API key is dropped so it cannot win over the token. The subscription
login stays untouched but unused.

A blank ``gateway_token`` alongside a set ``gateway_url`` is refused (raises
``ValueError``) rather than sent as ``ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=""``: an empty
override reads as "not logged in" in a container, or on a host with a stored
subscription login, as no override at all — the CLI would then fall back to
sending the user's real subscription OAuth token to the gateway instead of
the intended credential. ``volundr.adapters.outbound.contributors.
model_gateway.ModelGatewayContributor`` always supplies a non-blank token
(``OPEN_GATEWAY_TOKEN`` under 'none'/'envoy') whenever it sets
``gateway_url``, so this should only ever fire for a caller that bypassed
that contributor.

Trace propagation: Claude Code reads ``TRACEPARENT``/``TRACESTATE`` from its
own environment at startup in Agent SDK and non-interactive (``-p``) sessions,
and parents its ``claude_code.interaction`` span under them — documented at
https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/observability. Interactive sessions
ignore inbound ``TRACEPARENT`` (to avoid inheriting ambient CI/container
values), so the env var is harmless-but-inert there. This spawn env always
carries the caller's active W3C trace context (empty when observability is
disabled or no span is active), so whichever mode a transport uses gets it
for free.
