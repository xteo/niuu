"""Broker-provided session capabilities every transport wires into its agent.

The broker builds one :class:`SessionTools` per start and hands it to whichever
transport it constructs. A transport uses it to:

* export :attr:`SessionTools.env` into the agent process (the present-file shim's
  URL and the loopback token *file*),
* prepend :attr:`SessionTools.instructions` to the prompt it gives the agent,
* write generated engine configs (Claude MCP config, hook settings) into the
  broker-owned :attr:`SessionTools.runtime_dir` instead of the workspace, and
* authenticate Claude HTTP hooks with :attr:`SessionTools.loopback_authorization`.

Transports constructed without one (unit tests, harnesses) keep their previous
behaviour.
