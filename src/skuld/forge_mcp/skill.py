# Notifying the user from a Forge session

The `{server}` MCP server's `notify` tool puts a notification inline in this conversation, in
the Forge Notifications feed (every session, every host) and — through the user's own delivery
rules — on their phone or chat. It is how a long-running session gets the user's attention.

## When to notify

- `milestone` (usually `success`): a meaningful piece of work is finished — tests green,
  PR opened, migration applied, investigation concluded.
- `decision` (`info`): you made a significant choice the user should know about — approach
  picked, scope changed, something skipped on purpose.
- `attention` (`warning`): you are blocked or need input/approval to continue — say exactly
  what you need.
- `error` (`warning` or `critical`): something failed that the user must know about — broken
  build, data problem, missing credentials.
- `info` (`info`): a brief FYI worth surfacing outside the transcript.

## How to write one

{compact_guidance}

- **Links**: attach the artifact — a PR or CI URL (`kind: pr` / `url`), a file you handed over
  with `present-file` (`kind: file`, `file_id` from its output), another session (`kind: session`).
- **correlation_id**: reuse one id (e.g. the PR number) for follow-ups about the same thing.

## Do not

- Send progress updates or narrate routine steps. One good notification beats five chatty ones.
- Announce that the whole task is done just because your turn is ending — Forge raises
  "reply ready" automatically at the end of every turn. Reserve `milestone` for real outcomes.
- Resend a notification whose `state` came back `pending`: it is stored in the session's
  durable log and reaches Forge by itself once Forge is reachable.

`list_notifications` shows what was already reported (avoid duplicates); `environment` tells you
which session, host, project and model you are running as.
