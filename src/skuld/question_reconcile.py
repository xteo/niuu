"""Close every question the CLI is not asking, using its session file (LEX-1979).

A question can be open in three places: the transport's native-control card, the
broker's pending and restored ``ask_user_question`` lists (replayed to every client
that connects), and the conversation record (an AskUserQuestion tool_use with no
tool_result). The CLI's session file is the truth. For each question still open in
the record or the restored list, and not an open card the transport checks itself:

* its result is in the session file: close it with that answer;
* its tool call is not in the session file at all: close it as never shown;
* its tool call has no result: keep it while the pane shows a live menu (or at broker
  start, before the CLI has drawn anything), otherwise close it as no longer shown.

A close is an ``ask_user_resolved`` frame that goes through the broker's ordinary
event path, so it clears all three places, is logged, and reaches every client.
