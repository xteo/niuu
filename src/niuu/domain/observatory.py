"""Shared contracts for Observatory topology fragments and aggregation.

A *fragment* is one source's partial view of the topology. A Kubernetes scout, a
resident on a bare-metal host, a Docker container behind NAT and a static YAML
file all produce the same shape, so aggregation never needs to know what
produced one. That is what keeps the topology graph from being Kubernetes-shaped.

Lives in `niuu` rather than `observatory` because Guild aggregates fragments and
`niuu` must not import `observatory` — the dependency runs the other way.
