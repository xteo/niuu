"""The contract between the platform and the session brokers it serves (LEX-1957).

A session broker keeps running the release it was launched from: an API-only
promotion restarts Forge, not the brokers. When a release changes what Forge
expects of a broker (fields it records on a turn, frames it projects), a broker
launched from an older release silently lacks it. Each such change raises
``BROKER_CONTRACT``; a broker reports its level on ``/health`` and Forge's
``/sessions/{id}/runtime-version`` compares it with its own, so a promotion can
list, and restart, every session still below.

A broker that reports no level predates this module and is below level 1.
