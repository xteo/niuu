"""Which Forge routes a ``forge_session`` credential may call, and how.

This allow-list is shared by the two places that see such a token:

* Forge (Volundr) enforces it fully in ``ForgeSessionAuthMiddleware``, after
  verifying the token and checking the bound session and target ownership.
* The Guild facade applies the route and scope part before forwarding, so a
  refused call is refused at the edge too (Forge still decides).

Each allowed route names the scope it needs and how its ``{session_id}`` relates
to the token's own session: the session itself (``OWN``), any session of the same
owner (``OWNED``), or any *other* session of the same owner (``PEER``). Every
route not listed is closed to session credentials.
