"""Shared mesh peer identity model (NIU-631).

``MeshIdentity`` mirrors ``RavnIdentity`` but lives in ``niuu`` so that both
Ravn and Skuld can construct peer identities without cross-importing between
the two modules.

Discovery adapters accept ``own_identity: Any`` and read fields by name, so
``MeshIdentity`` is a drop-in replacement for ``RavnIdentity`` at runtime.
