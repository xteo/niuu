"""Shared outbound transport for calls this process makes to another Guild instance.

Every Guild remote call — Forge/Ravn aggregate REST requests, the Forge session
SSE stream, the reachability probe, both WebSocket proxy legs (resident/session
chat and Forge replay), and the Observatory/agent-directory HTTP clients —
resolves its transport trust through this one module: it is the single choke
point that enforces the LAN-transport policy (https:// unless
``config.allow_plaintext``) and an optional per-instance
``config.tls_fingerprint`` pin against whichever URL a caller actually dials,
instead of either being reimplemented (and possibly forgotten) at each call
site or trusted only once at registration time.

Callers must always pass the *dial_url* they are actually about to connect
to — an instance's ``base_url`` for most calls, but a split-service target's
``config.ravn_base_url`` for the Ravn aggregate/owner-probe legs (see
``rest_ravn._ravn_base_url``). Passing the wrong URL here would check and pin
the wrong host's certificate.

Embedded/in-process transports never reach this module: callers already
branch on ``config.transport == "embedded"`` before calling in (an embedded
instance's own ``base_url`` uses the ``embedded://`` scheme, which this
module's policy also exempts, for a caller that dials it directly).

    The single place every such call builds its client, so transport-policy
    and TLS-pin enforcement is applied identically to aggregate REST
    requests, the health probe, and the Observatory/agent-directory clients.
    Callers with an embedded-transport instance never reach this factory —
    see the module docstring.

    A pinned instance's client uses ``trust_env=False``. This is consistency,
    not protection an intercepting proxy could bypass: the certificate
    pre-fetch (``fetch_leaf_certificate_der``) is a raw socket connect that
    never consults ``HTTPS_PROXY``/``HTTP_PROXY`` and cannot traverse an HTTP
    CONNECT proxy, so pinning already requires a direct route to the
    instance before this client is even built. A proxy that re-signs the
    connection (a TLS-intercepting/MITM proxy) would already fail the pin's
    own certificate check and be refused, ``trust_env`` or not — that
    protection is the pin itself. Keeping the real request on the same
    direct path the pre-fetch used is what ``trust_env=False`` buys; its
    real-world consequence is a known limitation: an instance reachable only
    through a corporate/cluster egress proxy, with no direct route at all,
    cannot be pinned, because the pre-fetch cannot reach it either. An
    unpinned instance keeps httpx's normal proxy-env-var behavior, since
    there is no pin for a proxy hop to interact with.

    A pinned instance's client also forces ``follow_redirects=False``
    regardless of *follow_redirects*: httpx re-uses the same ``verify=``
    context for a redirect target, so a same-scheme redirect to a different
    host would already fail closed on the pin mismatch — but a redirect to
    plain ``http://`` bypasses TLS (and the pin) entirely, sending the
    caller's bearer wherever the redirect points. Refusing to follow means a
    misbehaving pinned instance shows up as a 3xx response, never a silent
    hop off the pinned connection. Raises ``ValueError`` if *transport* is
    also given for a pinned instance: httpx ignores ``verify=`` once a custom
    ``transport`` is set, so combining the two would silently build a client
    whose pin does nothing.

    *connect_timeout_seconds* overrides the shared connect-leg ceiling for
