"""Resolve notification channels and sinks from an owner's messaging integrations.

A MESSAGING ``integration_connection`` names an adapter class path, a credential
in the credential store, and adapter config. Two consumers read it:

* :class:`NotificationChannelFactory` (Ting's event notifications) builds every
  enabled connection of an owner as a best-effort
  :class:`~niuu.ports.notification_channel.NotificationChannel`. It moved here
  from ``ting.adapters.notification_channel_factory``, which re-exports it.
* :class:`IntegrationSinkResolver` (the Forge delivery outbox) builds ONE
  connection, named by a delivery rule, as a strict
  :class:`~niuu.ports.notifications.NotificationSink`.

Both use the dynamic adapter pattern, ``import_class(path)(**credential, **config)``.
The stored ``adapter`` is often not what a consumer needs: connections created
from the integration catalog may store an empty adapter, and older rows store
Ting channel paths. Two explicit tables close that gap, keyed by integration
slug; neither consumer branches on adapter types.
