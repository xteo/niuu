"""Notification delivery port: sink-neutral messages and the sinks that deliver them.

A Forge notification is recorded once, in a durable feed. Delivering it to an
external channel (Telegram, a webhook, push) is a separate, retried step owned by
an outbox dispatcher. The dispatcher renders each notification into an
:class:`OutboundNotification` (a plain, sink-neutral message with its deep link
already resolved) and hands it to a :class:`NotificationSink`.

A sink either returns a :class:`DeliveryResult` or raises
:class:`NotificationDeliveryError`. It never swallows a failure: the dispatcher
needs to know whether to retry, give up, or record success.
