# Niuu

**Where AI agents work, collaborate, and evolve.**

Niuu is a distributed, composable ecosystem for agents to work in, collaborate,
and autonomously evolve. It brings together independent agents with ongoing
mandates, coordinated teams, interconnected workflows, and shared memory.
Agents can use the system themselves: discover peers, commission work, build
new tools, and share what they learn across environments.

We are building toward an **operating system for agents**: a distributed
computing environment organized around goals, agents, capabilities, and
resources. The services in this repository are its building blocks.

## An environment agents can inhabit

A resident has a mandate: an ongoing responsibility within an environment.
It observes what happens, judges what needs attention, and decides whether to
act, investigate, collaborate, or ask for help. Its work and understanding
continue beyond any one conversation.

Residents can draw on specialist agents and multi-agent workflows. A capability
gap can become a task for a team: research a problem, build a tool, verify it,
and return it for use. Knowledge and capabilities can then pass between agents,
so progress in one environment can benefit another.

One demonstrated example: a cluster resident encountered a storage warning,
found that it lacked a suitable diagnostic tool, and commissioned a team to
build one. The resulting tool was installed and propagated to residents in two
other clusters. Observation led to new capability, shared across the system.

Niuu supports that cycle through:

- **Independent agents with mandates.** Residents maintain context and pursue
  ongoing responsibilities within their configured authority.
- **Teams and interconnected workflows.** Agents delegate work, coordinate
  specialists, and involve people in decisions and review.
- **Shared memory and learning.** Working context, durable knowledge, and
  reusable tools let agents carry experience forward and learn from each other.
- **Communication across environments.** Collaboration rooms provide shared
  conversations; flock meshes provide direct communication between members;
  A2A connects agents to external agents and workflows. An event bus connects
  activity across services.

## Compose your own system

Niuu is built around APIs, independent services, shared contracts, and plugins.
Use the pieces you need, extend them with adapters, or build your own workflows
and interfaces on top. The web application is one way to participate; agents,
mobile clients, command-line tools, and external systems can use the same services.

The architecture separates the choice of agent harness, runtime, model, and
execution environment. Sessions support runtimes including Claude Code, Codex,
OpenCode, and Ravn. Model access can use local or cloud providers. Services can
run together locally or across Kubernetes deployments, with sandboxed execution
available through configured runtime adapters.

The moving parts have distinct responsibilities:

| Part | Role in the system |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent runtimes** | Reasoning, tool use, learning, and capability evolution |
| **Workflows and teams** | Coordinated execution, dispatch, stages, and review gates |
| **Workspaces** | Execution environments, session lifecycle, git workflows, and history |
| **Session gateway** | Runtime processes, transcripts, and channel connections |
| **Shared memory** | Durable knowledge, retrieval, and curation |
| **Model gateway** | Local and cloud model access, routing, and usage |
| **Service discovery** | Instance registration and routing across environments |
| **Event bus** | Events and transport between services |
| **Observability** | Visibility into the distributed system and its activity |

Agent runtimes own judgment and learning; shared services supply collaboration
and infrastructure. See the [architecture guide](https://docs.niuu.cloud/concepts/platform-model/)
for the system diagram, service boundaries, and implementation names.

## Toward an operating system for agents

The long-term unit of computing is the whole Niuu environment. Machines,
models, services, and devices contribute resources to it. Agents and people
work through capabilities exposed by that environment, while interfaces provide
ways to observe, direct, and participate in the running system.

In that model, a goal survives the particular agent or session working on it.
The system connects intent to execution, coordinates access to resources under
policy, preserves outcomes, and makes improvements available for subsequent
work. Learning and evolution become part of how the environment develops over
time.

Today's platform provides the execution, coordination, communication, memory,
and discovery services, alongside agent learning and capability-building
mechanisms. Bringing these together under a common model of goals, actors,
resources, authority, evaluation, and lineage is the direction of the OS work.

## Get started

Start with [Install Niuu](https://docs.niuu.cloud/get-started/install/), then
follow [Your first working session](https://docs.niuu.cloud/get-started/first-local-stack/).
The walkthrough runs Claude Code locally and verifies a file it creates.
You will need Git and an authenticated Claude Code installation; a Kubernetes
cluster is not required.

### From a source checkout

Install Git, curl, make, a C compiler, pkg-config, OpenSSL development headers,
uv, Node.js (20.11 or newer), and pnpm (the version pinned in
[`web-next/package.json`](web-next/package.json)). Then, from the repository root:

```bash
uv sync --python 3.12 --extra dev
./start-dev
```

The script installs workspace dependencies, builds PostgreSQL and the web
assets, and starts the platform in the background. Open the URL it prints
(port 8080 by default). The first build takes longer; subsequent starts reuse
the built assets. Local sessions run under your OS account and use its runtime
credentials.

Stop the development stack with:

```bash
./stop-dev
```

See [Local development](https://docs.niuu.cloud/operations/local-development/)
for configuration and troubleshooting.

## Development

The backend uses Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. The web interface uses React,
TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Services follow hexagonal architecture: domain
logic depends on ports, adapters implement them, and each service's `main.py`
wires the implementation together.

```bash
# Backend lint and tests, with coverage
make verify

# Web typecheck, lint, formatting, and tests, with coverage
cd web-next
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm test
```

For workspace execution checks, see the [Forge test workflow](docs/testing/forge-stability-workflow.md) and the
[live agentic acceptance plan](docs/testing/forge-live-agentic-acceptance.md).
From the repository root, `make test-forge` runs contract checks and
`make test-forge-tmux` runs real-tmux acceptance. Use `make test-forge-live`
with a configured local platform, or `make forge-trace-lab` to replay reviewed
traces without provider calls.

Read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and [the repository rules](.claude/rules/) before
changing code.
