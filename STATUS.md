# forge-artifacts lane (LEX-1397, under LEX-1387): status

Branch `exp/cp-forge-artifacts`, cut from `origin/exp/control-plane` at `33087ca2`.
Lands on niuu `exp/control-plane` (xteo fork). Deploys only through cp-platform to exp Forge (:8380).

## Checklist

| Item | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| F1 projector at ingest (hook rows, present_file turns, notify links, report_artifact) | done | `volundr/domain/artifacts.py`; `rest_session_log._project_artifacts_isolated`; tests `test_artifacts_extraction.py` (35), `test_rest_session_log_artifacts.py` |
| F1 internal backfill (SQL replay of `session_event_log`) | done | `PostgresArtifactPublicationRepository.scan_log`; `POST /artifact-publications/backfill` (admin); `artifacts.backfill_on_start` |
| F1 `forge_artifact_publications` + `GET /artifact-publications` (**F1a**) | done | migration `000088` (dirs `migrations/`, `src/cli/migrations/volundr/`, Helm configmap); `GET /artifact-bursts?after=<rev>` too |
| F1 `report_artifact` MCP tool | done | `niuu/domain/artifact_reports.py`, broker host + toolbox; transcript mode only |
| F1 capture-manifest golden (230 rows, 26 keys; replay inserts 0) | done | memory + real Postgres: thor 122, mini-m6 108, exact occurrence sets, 26 keys, second replay 0 |
| Codex present-file shape | done | `test_present_file_from_the_brokers_own_producer` (Skuld's producer, the turn Codex writes) |
| F1n bursts: persisted `burst_id`, late joins, bridges, silent backfill | done | platform B1–B9 + model B1–B6 on memory **and** Postgres |
| F1n durable 120 s hold, restart recovery, transactional suppression recheck | done | `ArtifactHold`; `emit()` one transaction; B6 restart test; restart-during-hold emits once |
| F1n golden (33 bursts, 25 notices) | done | memory + Postgres; mutation check: hold 0 → 33 notices, hold 600 → 22 (design §V1's figures) |
| F7 `GET /instance` (host, tailnet name; gateway adds self id + slug) | done | `rest_artifacts.create_instance_router`; facade `/instance` |
| F1t `Artifact.type` / `marker` | done | `TypeCatalog` (type URL, then front-matter name); per publication `type`/`marker` |
| Full app smoke (real lifespan, scratch PG) | done | append → live pub → burst → "Smoke page published" (art-burst:…) after hold → backfill 0 |
| Full backend suite + coverage gate | done | 26742 passed, coverage 88% (gate 85); the 14 failures (install.sh, Docker, ravn kickoff, release guard) fail identically on the untouched base |
| Review | done | independent review: no wedge or feed breakage; fixed burst `rev` ordering in emit/settle, suppression recheck under the feed lock, one bad burst no longer stalls the hold (settled `emit_failed` after 5), backfill stops at now − live lag, deadlocks are 503, one report per turn |
| Merge `exp/control-plane`, land, record sha | pending | |
| Send sha to cp-platform (RF); E0 on exp stack | pending | |
| LEX-1397 comment | pending | |

## Decisions (docs-supported, noted here instead of asking)

- **Host name** of publications/bursts: `host_identity.host`; empty falls back to
  `projects.instance_id` (exp Forge: `thor-exp`, the manifest's exp host key), then `local`.
- **Which rows form bursts:** Artifact-tool publishes and `report_artifact` reports of claude.ai
  artifacts. Notify links of kind `artifact` are recorded as publications (provenance, §5.2 path 3)
  but are announcements (model/bursts.md), so they never join or open a burst. Presented files are
  recorded, never burst (design §V1: no notice for files in Slice 0).
- **Suppression** (model/bursts.md, any session): an `agent` notice linking the artifact, created in
  `[started_at − 30 min, min(emission, last_at + 30 min)]`, suppresses; Slice 0's own system notices
  never count. Rechecked inside the emission transaction. Same predicate as the model's
  announcement (`announces`, tested against model B6).
- **Live vs backfill:** live when ingest sees the row within 10 min of its `ts`; the internal
  backfill always writes `backfill`.
- **Revision id:** `rev_` + sha256(`<provider>:<key>|<provider_version>`)[:32]; without a version,
  hashed with host, session and tool-use id (design §5.1 gives no exact formula).
- **Burst feed:** `GET /artifact-bursts?after=<rev>` added beside `/artifact-publications`, because
  late joins widen a burst after its publications were served; `rev` advances on every change.
- **`report_artifact`** writes a `conversation.turn` (`metadata.kind = artifact_report`), its own
  shape rather than a notification, so a report never becomes a notice.
- **Release gap:** not merged. `exp/control-plane` already has session descriptions (3e603dd6) and
  the attachments index; the release-only commits are notification images, which Slice 0 does not
  use. Branch sync stays cp-platform's X1.
- **Wire:** cp-api-v1 1.0.0 untouched (these are Forge-side routes C4 reads).
- **A burst spanning several owners' sessions** (B1 allows it) is visible to, and announced to,
  the seed session's owner. Single-owner hosts today (dev-user); revisit if Forge hosts multiple
  owners.
- **A live row arriving late** (3–10 min) opens a burst already due, so its hold is short; this
  matches the reference (`due = at + hold`).
