## Package 2 (relayed 2026-10-22): RF+E0, F8, C4, R9

| Row | Repo / branch | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| RF + E0 | niuu, exp Forge | done (item 4 pending) | see the E0 row above; **config ask:** exp Forge's `/instance` reports `tailnet_name: 100.66.123.128`, not a tailnet name. cp-platform: set `host_identity.tailnet_name: thor.tail737f2a.ts.net` (DEPLOY-REQUEST) |
| F8 m6 on par | niuu `exp/cp-forge-artifacts` | re-review | review 1: 2 BLOCKER + 4 MAJOR, all fixed (write mode refuses production ports and needs the scratch id; read mode pinned with `scope=local`; full Forge route-set compare; recorded-OpenAPI mode; the gateway's 422→501 masking fixed). Branch Thor vs m6 shape **ON PAR 39/39**; live Thor `11afe41d` serves one route the branch lacks (notification images, see below). `docs/operator/forge-parity.md`, `docs/operator/f8-parity/` |
| C4 Artifact registry + lens | lexi-frontend `exp/cp-artifacts` | building | ownership **agreed** (cp-core's answer, relayed): `artifacts.ts`, `artifacts-ingest.ts` (via `store.ingestBatch`, `expForgeBase`/`expForgeOrigin`/`fetchJson`), `views/artifacts.ts` in the shared views module; one-line hooks in `views/router.ts` VIEW_ROUTES and `runtime.ts` start/close |
| R9 Fragment session and ids | lexi-ios `exp/cp-fragment-ids` | **landed** `a76587ef` on lexi-ios `exp/control-plane` | `notes.py fragment` mints `f-<16 hex>` once, records `{host, session_id}` (host from `PROJECTS__INSTANCE_ID` via `keys.HOST_MAP`; refuses inside Forge without one), step ids `<feature_id>#<i>:<sha8>`; `<N>.md` `features[]` is the one source R1's `ShipUploaded` reads (validates against the frozen schema); duplicate ids refused. Identity cases 8/8; `tools/release` 145 tests (1 known `/bin/zsh` error); `release-check` OK. Two reviews. Swift `ReleaseNotesTests` run on the next train (no Xcode on Thor) |

### C4 file ownership: proposal to cp-core (agreed with changes; see the C4 row)

C4 builds on cp-core's store at `507deef` and does **not edit** cp-core's files except two one-line hooks:

- **C4 owns (new files)** in `services/lexi-agent-service/control-plane/`:
  - `artifacts.ts`: the registry projection (publications → artifacts by `provider_key`, revisions by provider version, project from the producing session's current project) and the CP side of the burst rule (`bursts.py` port; reads Forge's `burst_id`, records `burst` occurrences through `store.recordOccurrence()`). Its tables are created by `artifacts.ts` on the same db (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artifact_*`), so `store.ts`'s schema is untouched.
  - `artifacts-ingest.ts`: polls exp Forge's `GET /artifact-publications?after=` and `GET /artifact-bursts?after=` (F1a, final) through the same allow-listed exp-Forge base as `ExpForgeIngest`, and hands publication rows to `store.apply` with `feed: 'publications'` (the shape cp-core's `applyPublication` already takes).
  - `views-artifacts.ts`: `GET /v1/cp/views/artifacts` (scope all/recent/project, `opens: system_browser`) and the `Project.artifacts` top-5 helper.
  - `__tests__/artifacts.test.ts` and fixtures under `contract/artifacts/`.
- **One-line hooks in cp-core's files:** `routes.ts` (register the view) and `runtime.ts` (start the artifacts poller next to `ExpForgeIngest`). If cp-core prefers to make those two edits, C4 exports `registerArtifactRoutes(app, deps)` and `startArtifactIngest(deps)`.
- **Ask:** if cp-core already plans publications ingest in `ingest.ts` now that F1a is final, say so and C4 drops `artifacts-ingest.ts`.

Until I hear back, C4 work stays in the new files only.

### F8 findings for the coordinator

1. **Release gap blocks parity at P1.** Live Thor (`11afe41d`) serves `GET /api/v1/forge/notifications/{notification_id}/image`; `exp/control-plane` doesn't (the release-only notification images). Before P1, cp-platform's X1 (branch sync) must bring that commit into `exp/control-plane`, or m6 isn't on par and Thor loses the route.
2. **The m6 attach 501 is not a missing route.** A well-formed attach works through Thor@`11afe41d` → m6@`6c31bfe1`. A 501 is either `PUT /description` (missing at `6c31bfe1`) or a **masked domain refusal**: both revisions' gateways turned any 422 into "update the host" when `role`/`parent` was sent (the CP always sends `role`). Fixed on the branch (`_rejects_unknown_fields`); it takes effect on m6 once m6 runs the branch.
3. **The probe's read mode is not on the production allow-list** (boot-0: no routes). Running it against production at P1 needs the allow-list's owner to add `/instance`, `/artifact-publications`, `/artifact-bursts`, `/notifications`, `/openapi.json` and `/health` (all statically zero-write).

### Reuse check (VISION §0, D29)

- **F8:** reused the served `/openapi.json`, `/instance` (F7) and the existing facade attach/description routes. New: `scripts/forge_parity_probe.py`, because `scripts/forge_live.py` creates billable sessions and needs httpx (not on m6's system python), and `scripts/extract_openapi.py` builds mocked node routers rather than what a host serves under its mount list. Gateway fix: a 20-line helper in `rest_volundr.py`, no new type.
- **E0:** reused the test harness (`tests/support/artifacts.manifest_log_rows`) and Forge's own log append and backfill routes; nothing new in `src/`.
- **R9:** extended `tools/release/notes.py`, `cp_producer.py` and `train.py`; R1's producer now reads the train's `<N>.md` instead of a second builder. New: `test_fragment_ids.py` and the vendored identity fixture.
- **C4:** reused cp-core's store (`publications`, `sessions`, `notifications`, `ingestBatch`, `recordOccurrence`), the views module (`sessionRef`, `projectRef`, `allArtifacts`, router auth), `schema.ts`, `fetchJson`/`expForgeBase`/`expForgeOrigin`, `identity.ts` `uuid5`/`eventId`, and Forge's `burst_id` and burst feed. New: `artifact_*` tables, because the store has nowhere to keep persisted burst ids, membership, bridges or the bursts-feed cursor (`setCursor` is private, keyed by feed), plus `artifact_file_bases`.

## Decisions (docs-supported, noted here instead of asking)

- **Host name** of publications/bursts: `host_identity.host`; empty falls back to
  `projects.instance_id` (exp Forge: `thor-exp`, the manifest's exp host key), then `local`.
- **Which rows form bursts:** Artifact-tool publishes and `report_artifact` reports of claude.ai
  artifacts. Notify links of kind `artifact` are recorded as publications (provenance, §5.2 path 3)
  but are announcements (model/bursts.md), so they never join or open a burst. Presented files are
  recorded, never burst (design §V1: no notice for files in Slice 0).
- **Suppression** (model/bursts.md, any session): an `agent` notice linking the artifact, created in
  `[started_at − 30 min, min(emission, last_at + 30 min)]`, suppresses; Slice 0's own system notices
  never count. Rechecked inside the emission transaction. Same predicate as the model's
  announcement (`announces`, tested against model B6).
- **Live vs backfill:** live when ingest sees the row within 10 min of its `ts`; the internal
  backfill always writes `backfill`.
- **Revision id:** `rev_` + sha256(`<provider>:<key>|<provider_version>`)[:32]; without a version,
  hashed with host, session and tool-use id (design §5.1 gives no exact formula).
- **Burst feed:** `GET /artifact-bursts?after=<rev>` added beside `/artifact-publications`, because
  late joins widen a burst after its publications were served; `rev` advances on every change.
- **`report_artifact`** writes a `conversation.turn` (`metadata.kind = artifact_report`), its own
  shape rather than a notification, so a report never becomes a notice.
- **Release gap:** not merged. `exp/control-plane` already has session descriptions (3e603dd6) and
  the attachments index; the release-only commits are notification images, which Slice 0 does not
  use. Branch sync stays cp-platform's X1.
- **Wire:** cp-api-v1 1.0.0 untouched (these are Forge-side routes C4 reads).
- **A burst spanning several owners' sessions** (B1 allows it) is visible to, and announced to,
  the seed session's owner. Single-owner hosts today (dev-user); revisit if Forge hosts multiple
  owners.
- **F8 health:** the probe judges `/health` on the Forge plugins only (volundr, guild, niuu); m6 disables ting, mimir, ravn and observatory on purpose.
- **F8 read mode** makes no per-session reads (they reach the owner lookup, which writes: `exp/prod-read-allowlist.json`); attach and create are checked in `--write` mode against loopback Forges only.
- **A live row arriving late** (3–10 min) opens a burst already due, so its hold is short; this
  matches the reference (`due = at + hold`).

Full suite: 26,731 pass; the 17 failures are identical on the untouched base (box-specific:
install_sh, ting turn timeouts, docker_container, api_release_guard, ravn kickoff).

## Decisions (docs-supported, noted here instead of asking)

- **F12d `open_controls`** comes from the broker's control state (design §V9.2: `[{request_id,
  opened_at}]`, plus `kind`), carried in every activity report's metadata and served from
  `activity_metadata`. `null` = unknown (older broker, or awaiting input with no request id),
  never "none open". Resolving one of two gates forces a refresh so the list shrinks.
- **F12d storage:** two columns on `sessions` (`last_work_at`, `open_tool_count`), folded in the
  same single UPDATE as `latest_final_*` per inserted row, so producer retries are idempotent.
  The work-row predicate is one module (`niuu.domain.work_facts`) used by Skuld and Forge.
- **F12c** never guesses idle for a transport that doesn't report its own turn flag; it only
  stops heartbeating. The liveness reaper is off by default, so that is safe.
- **F11b field names** follow the frozen contract (`question`, `about_question`), not design
  §V8.4's older `ask`/`resolves`. Stored in `forge_notifications.metadata` (no migration),
  served on the read wire and the SSE payload (null when unset). Forge does not enforce the
  producer rule; the control plane does (C3a). The tool description states it.
- **F11b `<host>`:** Forge doesn't know the control plane's host key, so the description tells
  agents to build `question:<host>:<notification_id>` with the host key (thor, mini-m6). No
  `question_ref` is returned.
- **F2 trust model:** Forge on the tailnet serves reads without auth (mini mode), so the
  durable URL needs no token: `presented_files.public_base_url` + the existing route. The
  config refuses `*.xteo.mesh` and non-http(s).
- **F2 storage:** dynamic-adapter store (`LocalPresentedFileStore`, `~/.niuu/presented-files`),
  no DB table, so F1 keeps sole ownership of publication rows.

## F1/F2 boundary (cp-forge-artifacts)

I couldn't message cp-forge-artifacts: this session has no `message` grant. The boundary I took,
based on its STATUS.md and code:
- **F2 (here):** the durable copy, the upload route, the durable-first GET, and the absolute URL.
  The broker writes the URL into the `present_file` turn's `tool_input.url`.
- **F1 (theirs):** publication rows. Their `_present_file` builds a relative
  `/api/v1/forge/sessions/{sid}/files/presented/{file_id}`. It can prefer `tool_input.url` when
  present, or build it with `volundr.domain.presented_files.durable_file_url(base, sid, fid)`.
- **At landing** (F1 landed first, at `9f145a1a`, then renumbered its migration to 000089 in
  `16e0e48d`): mine stays 000088; config sections merged; both lanes' status kept here, one
  section each. F1's `_present_file` now records the turn's `tool_input.url` when it is a valid
  tailnet http(s) URL, otherwise the relative route as before
  (`tests/test_volundr/test_presented_files_durable.py`).

## For cp-platform (exp deploy)

The durable store is **off by default** (review: the local store is not durable on k8s). The exp
Forge overlay needs:

```yaml
presented_files:
  enabled: true
  public_base_url: "http://thor.tail737f2a.ts.net:8380"
```

Without `public_base_url`, files are durable but keep the relative route.

## Review: fixed, and deferred

Fixed:
- inline durable files carry `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` and `nosniff`;
- F12c never guesses idle for transports on the port's default `is_turn_active`;
- the registry rebuild never serves the durable receipt;
- `update()` returns the stored work facts;
- the store is off by default;
- the PUT body is streamed with the size limit;
- the inline upload wait is capped at 5 s (then a background retry);
- frames that change nothing skip the session write;
- the hook-name lookup matches the SQL exactly;
- the refresh's attention detail names the gate still open.

Deferred (noted, not blocking boot 0):
- child/teammate Claude hooks are not filtered from the work facts, matching the reference
  `derived_state.py`, which doesn't filter them either;
- no cleanup of durable files on session delete;
- background upload retries are lost if the broker restarts before they succeed, with no rescan;
- two concurrent PUTs of different bytes under one id could interleave (only the session's own
  broker can PUT, with a fresh random id).

## Blockers

- **No cross-session message grant** (`forge_mcp.grants` lacks `message`). I can't send the sha to
  cp-platform or agree the boundary with cp-forge-artifacts myself. The coordinator has to relay
  it, or grant `message`.
