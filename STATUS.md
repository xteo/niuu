# forge-artifacts lane (LEX-1397, under LEX-1387): status

Branch `exp/cp-forge-artifacts`, cut from `origin/exp/control-plane` at `33087ca2`.
Lands on niuu `exp/control-plane` (xteo fork). Deploys only through cp-platform to exp Forge (:8380).

## Decisions (docs-supported, noted here instead of asking)

- **Host name** of publications/bursts: `host_identity.host`; empty falls back to
  `projects.instance_id` (exp Forge: `thor-exp`, the manifest's exp host key), then `local`.
- **Which rows form bursts:** Artifact-tool publishes and `report_artifact` reports of claude.ai
  artifacts. Notify links of kind `artifact` are recorded as publications (provenance, §5.2 path 3)
  but are announcements (model/bursts.md), so they never join or open a burst. Presented files are
  recorded, never burst (design §V1: no notice for files in Slice 0).
- **Suppression** (model/bursts.md, any session): an `agent` notice linking the artifact, created in
  `[started_at − 30 min, min(emission, last_at + 30 min)]`, suppresses; Slice 0's own system notices
  never count. Rechecked inside the emission transaction. Same predicate as the model's
  announcement (`announces`, tested against model B6).
- **Live vs backfill:** live when ingest sees the row within 10 min of its `ts`; the internal
  backfill always writes `backfill`.
- **Revision id:** `rev_` + sha256(`<provider>:<key>|<provider_version>`)[:32]; without a version,
  hashed with host, session and tool-use id (design §5.1 gives no exact formula).
- **Burst feed:** `GET /artifact-bursts?after=<rev>` added beside `/artifact-publications`, because
  late joins widen a burst after its publications were served; `rev` advances on every change.
- **`report_artifact`** writes a `conversation.turn` (`metadata.kind = artifact_report`), its own
  shape rather than a notification, so a report never becomes a notice.
- **Release gap:** not merged. `exp/control-plane` already has session descriptions (3e603dd6) and
  the attachments index; the release-only commits are notification images, which Slice 0 does not
  use. Branch sync stays cp-platform's X1.
- **Wire:** cp-api-v1 1.0.0 untouched (these are Forge-side routes C4 reads).
- **A burst spanning several owners' sessions** (B1 allows it) is visible to, and announced to,
  the seed session's owner. Single-owner hosts today (dev-user); revisit if Forge hosts multiple
  owners.
- **A live row arriving late** (3–10 min) opens a burst already due, so its hold is short; this
  matches the reference (`due = at + hold`).

Full suite: 26,731 pass; the 17 failures are identical on the untouched base (box-specific:
install_sh, ting turn timeouts, docker_container, api_release_guard, ravn kickoff).

## Decisions (docs-supported, noted here instead of asking)

- **F12d `open_controls`** comes from the broker's control state (design §V9.2: `[{request_id,
  opened_at}]`, plus `kind`), carried in every activity report's metadata and served from
  `activity_metadata`. `null` = unknown (older broker, or awaiting input with no request id),
  never "none open". Resolving one of two gates forces a refresh so the list shrinks.
- **F12d storage:** two columns on `sessions` (`last_work_at`, `open_tool_count`), folded in the
  same single UPDATE as `latest_final_*` per inserted row, so producer retries are idempotent.
  The work-row predicate is one module (`niuu.domain.work_facts`) used by Skuld and Forge.
- **F12c** never guesses idle for a transport that doesn't report its own turn flag; it only
  stops heartbeating. The liveness reaper is off by default, so that is safe.
- **F11b field names** follow the frozen contract (`question`, `about_question`), not design
  §V8.4's older `ask`/`resolves`. Stored in `forge_notifications.metadata` (no migration),
  served on the read wire and the SSE payload (null when unset). Forge does not enforce the
  producer rule; the control plane does (C3a). The tool description states it.
- **F11b `<host>`:** Forge doesn't know the control plane's host key, so the description tells
  agents to build `question:<host>:<notification_id>` with the host key (thor, mini-m6). No
  `question_ref` is returned.
- **F2 trust model:** Forge on the tailnet serves reads without auth (mini mode), so the
  durable URL needs no token: `presented_files.public_base_url` + the existing route. The
  config refuses `*.xteo.mesh` and non-http(s).
- **F2 storage:** dynamic-adapter store (`LocalPresentedFileStore`, `~/.niuu/presented-files`),
  no DB table, so F1 keeps sole ownership of publication rows.

## F1/F2 boundary (cp-forge-artifacts)

I couldn't message cp-forge-artifacts: this session has no `message` grant. The boundary I took,
based on its STATUS.md and code:
- **F2 (here):** the durable copy, the upload route, the durable-first GET, and the absolute URL.
  The broker writes the URL into the `present_file` turn's `tool_input.url`.
- **F1 (theirs):** publication rows. Their `_present_file` builds a relative
  `/api/v1/forge/sessions/{sid}/files/presented/{file_id}`. It can prefer `tool_input.url` when
  present, or build it with `volundr.domain.presented_files.durable_file_url(base, sid, fid)`.
- **At landing** (F1 landed first, at `9f145a1a`, then renumbered its migration to 000089 in
  `16e0e48d`): mine stays 000088; config sections merged; both lanes' status kept here, one
  section each. F1's `_present_file` now records the turn's `tool_input.url` when it is a valid
  tailnet http(s) URL, otherwise the relative route as before
  (`tests/test_volundr/test_presented_files_durable.py`).

## For cp-platform (exp deploy)

The durable store is **off by default** (review: the local store is not durable on k8s). The exp
Forge overlay needs:

```yaml
presented_files:
  enabled: true
  public_base_url: "http://thor.tail737f2a.ts.net:8380"
```

Without `public_base_url`, files are durable but keep the relative route.

## Review: fixed, and deferred

Fixed:
- inline durable files carry `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` and `nosniff`;
- F12c never guesses idle for transports on the port's default `is_turn_active`;
- the registry rebuild never serves the durable receipt;
- `update()` returns the stored work facts;
- the store is off by default;
- the PUT body is streamed with the size limit;
- the inline upload wait is capped at 5 s (then a background retry);
- frames that change nothing skip the session write;
- the hook-name lookup matches the SQL exactly;
- the refresh's attention detail names the gate still open.

Deferred (noted, not blocking boot 0):
- child/teammate Claude hooks are not filtered from the work facts, matching the reference
  `derived_state.py`, which doesn't filter them either;
- no cleanup of durable files on session delete;
- background upload retries are lost if the broker restarts before they succeed, with no rescan;
- two concurrent PUTs of different bytes under one id could interleave (only the session's own
  broker can PUT, with a fresh random id).

## Blockers

- **No cross-session message grant** (`forge_mcp.grants` lacks `message`). I can't send the sha to
  cp-platform or agree the boundary with cp-forge-artifacts myself. The coordinator has to relay
  it, or grant `message`.
