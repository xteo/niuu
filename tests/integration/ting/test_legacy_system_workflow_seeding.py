"""Real-Postgres regression test for the pre-#1012 legacy system row bug.

Reproduces, against a real PostgreSQL 16 (via `txn_pool`), the startup crash
an independent reviewer found: `seed_system_workflows` raising
`WorkflowConflictError("A different immutable workflow version already
exists")` for legacy system rows migration 000046 reclassifies to
`version_origin: bundled`. That crash came from `_advance()` archiving the
legacy row and the new packaged head under the same `(id, version)` slot
when their versions match — `_InMemoryWorkflowRepository`-based unit tests
cannot reproduce it, since they have no archive-conflict semantics.

Setup mirrors production: real system rows shaped exactly like pre-#1012
content (no persona pins, `schema_version` defaulted to 1, no recorded
`workflow_versions` history, `version_origin: authored` from migration
000044's backfill) plus one ordinary user-scope row, then migration 000046's
own SQL applied directly, then the real `seed_system_workflows` against a
real `PostgresWorkflowRepository`.
