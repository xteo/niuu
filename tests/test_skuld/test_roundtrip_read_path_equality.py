"""Epic F invariant suite — INV-5 (the headline round-trip), INV-1, INV-10.

THE HEADLINE CONTRACT (SRD §7, INV-5):

    what you saw LIVE (post-gate)
        == what you REPLAY from after=0 (post-gate)
        == what you COLD-READ via GET /log (default gated)

…frame-for-frame, over ONE shared durable log and ONE shared visibility gate
(:func:`skuld.channels.filter_internal_blocks`). This is the seam where Epic A
(durable superset), Epic B (one shared reducer) and Epic D (read-path
unification) meet: a single mixed turn is driven through a *real*
``skuld.broker.Broker`` and then read back through all three surfaces.

Self-contained: no tmux, no real Postgres, no aiohttp, no live IDP. The Broker
is wired the MINIMAL manual way (no ``startup()``) — same approach as
``tests/support/forge/broker_harness.py`` documents: a truthy
``volundr_api_url`` so ``_enqueue_event_log`` buffers, and the flush loop is
NEVER started so the buffer accumulates and is fully readable. The Volundr HTTP
client is stubbed so the broker's background reporters (activity / usage /
timeline / trace spans / pipeline) touch no network.

Shared fakes are reused by IMPORT only (no edits to conftest / support):

* ``tests.test_adapters.test_rest_session_log.InMemoryLog`` — the one durable
  log fake (mirrors the ``pg_session_event_log`` contract).
* ``volundr.adapters.inbound.rest_session_log.create_session_log_router`` — the
  cold-read GET /log surface (Epic D, default gated).
* ``volundr.adapters.inbound.ws_session_replay.create_session_replay_router`` —
  the replay-as-live WS surface (Epic D, default gated).
* ``skuld.channels.WebSocketChannel`` / ``filter_internal_blocks`` — the ONE
  live broadcast gate.

INV coverage here (genuine gaps, not duplicating Epics A–D):

* INV-5  — the unified three-way round-trip equality (the headline test).
* INV-1  — every frame a live client saw is present in the durable log
  (superset), systematically across ALL frame kinds in the mixed turn,
  appended BEFORE it is broadcast.
* INV-10 — visibility parity: the dropped set is identical across the three
  read paths because they share ``filter_internal_blocks``.

The autouse ``tests/test_skuld/conftest.py`` fixture strips ambient
``SKULD__*``/``VOLUNDR*`` env, so this file (under ``tests/test_skuld``) does not
strip them itself.
