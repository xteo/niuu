"""Epic A invariants — the durable event log is a complete superset of the
live broadcast (INV-1) and is gapless with a detectable overflow sentinel
(INV-2).

The contract under test: every frame that reaches a live client (via
``_channels.broadcast`` or a per-channel ``send_json``) MUST have been appended
to the durable event-log buffer FIRST. Broker-originated frames (errors,
permission_*, available_commands, the intermediary user_* events) now funnel
through ``_emit_broker_frame`` / ``_send_broker_frame_to`` so the superset
invariant is structural, not vigilance-based.
