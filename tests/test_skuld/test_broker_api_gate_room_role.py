"""The broker's own gate-resolve route requires the stamped room role.

Defense-in-depth: a caller who reaches this route via the generic session-proxy
HTTP passthrough (/s/{id}/api/...) only needed "attach" to get there — any
active participant, not just an approver/owner. This route additionally
requires the session-proxy-verified x-niuu-room-role header to be owner or
approver, independent of Volundr's own REST-layer Cedar check (which stamps
its own "approver" value on its direct-to-broker call; see
volundr.adapters.inbound.rest.ROOM_ROLE_HEADER).
