# Resident Valkyrie Judgment Loop

**Status:** Durable external-event judgment and model-runtime interchange are
locally proven against real dependencies; the operator round-trip is
mechanically proven but not deployed end to end; completed A2A work, tool
construction/reuse, and repeated behavioral quality are not yet proven
**Date:** 2026-07-21
**Scope:** Ravn resident Valkyries, environment signals, resident continuity,
Mímir, tool evolution, and agent-to-agent work

## Executive conclusion

The platform already contains most of the mechanisms needed for a situated,
judgment-capable resident agent:

- durable environment signals
- an iterative LLM/tool loop
- native, learned, skill, workflow, and A2A capabilities
- human-help events and review surfaces
- task budgets, permissions, verification, canaries, and rollback
- resident continuation and state types
- long-term knowledge storage

This branch connects several previously open runtime paths. A local Ivaldi
process running this branch has consumed real retained Laevateinn events from
the deployed JetStream stream, called the configured Nemotron model, used real
tools, published real runtime-owned outcome provenance, and exported causal
traces and metrics to Glitnir. Earlier diagnostic runs also exercised Mímir;
the current clean baseline removes knowledge Mímir from Ivaldi's capability
surface entirely. That proves an end-to-end local signal and judgment path; it
does not prove good repeated judgment, operator
question/resume, or autonomous tool construction and later reuse. The
checked-in cluster Ivaldi deployment still does not run this branch. The
existing platform deployment does include the earlier A2A tool-build stack.

The required change is not a new planner, classifier, memory service, objective
engine, or agent framework. It is a re-stitch:

> Give the resident one durable case, one coherent capability surface, one
> resumable action loop, and externally verifiable consequences. Let the model
> choose whether to inspect, research, ask, delegate, build, wait, or finish.
> Keep safety and operational invariants outside the model.

This is a step toward bounded, situated, self-extending agency. It is not model
weight self-improvement or AGI. The resident can nevertheless improve its
understanding, working methods, tools, schedules, shared knowledge, and use of
other agents.

## Architectural destination: Ravn as the autonomous agent boundary

The Codor comparison establishes a boundary that simplifies this work rather
than adding another subsystem:

> **Ravn is the autonomous agent that wraps models and runtimes such as Codex,
> Claude Code, and Nemotron. A Valkyrie is a Niuu-managed Ravn. Niuu provides
> Flokks, direct meshes, Skuld rooms, identity, deployment, and infrastructure.**

The current repository does not yet respect that boundary consistently. Ravn
contains agent semantics and some concrete Niuu infrastructure concerns, while
Skuld currently wraps several execution runtimes directly. The direction is to
put model and runtime adapters beneath Ravn and expose Niuu collaboration and
infrastructure through ports, without introducing another agent loop.

The stable Ravn-to-runtime contract should remain small:

```text
input:  prompt | resume | interrupt | human_input
output: session_started | text_delta | tool_started | tool_completed
        input_required | turn_completed | turn_failed
query:  capabilities
```

Ravn owns the judgment and action loop, durable cases and continuation,
evidence-backed learning, capability evolution, A2A interaction with external
agents and systems, runtime/model adapters, permissions, and the normalized
event stream. Niuu owns Valkyrie identity and lifecycle, Flokk membership and
direct mesh infrastructure, Skuld rooms and channels, workload identity,
Kubernetes, gateways, registries, and the HUD.

This makes the current operator path precise. Ravn judges that input is
required and persists the exact suspended case. Skuld projects that request
into a room that humans and other Ravns may join, and routes the answer back to
the exact case. Telegram is a Skuld room channel, not a Ravn cognitive feature.
Skuld does not own the continuation decision.

It also makes the Codex/Nemotron comparison honest. Model/runtime, Ravn, and
Niuu become separate variables: Ravn can use Nemotron directly or wrap Codex
or Claude Code as a richer execution runtime while retaining the same case,
judgment, learning, and evidence contracts.

The intended adoption surface is correspondingly small:

```text
ravn                         # run the autonomous agent
niuu valkyrie start --runtime codex
niuu flokk join <flokk> --as <role>
niuu doctor
```

Niuu may auto-detect and attach an already-running Ravn. Joining a Flokk must
be durable and explicit about execution custody. Discovery alone never implies
admission or authority.

The extraction order is intentionally narrow:

1. Define and prove the Ravn-to-runtime contract with direct-model and Codex
   adapters.
2. Keep judgment, learning, continuation, capability evolution, and A2A in
   Ravn while moving concrete Niuu infrastructure behind ports.
3. Make Flokk mesh, Skuld room, and A2A paths explicit and separately traced.
4. Prove the same Ravn case over more than one runtime.
5. Split packaging or repositories only when it reduces coupling rather than
   moving it.

The operator walking slice remains worth completing now, but it must test this
boundary: one Ravn-owned suspended case, one Niuu-owned Skuld room route, one
answer from a human or another Ravn, and one exact-case resume under a single
trace. It must not establish a direct Ravn-to-Telegram dependency.

## Evidence provenance

This document combines three evidence sources:

1. A repository trace of the current Ravn, Sleipnir, Skuld, Ting, ODIN, and
   Mímir paths.
2. Live observations from the workshop resident investigation:
   - Nemotron/vLLM successfully returned a native tool call in a direct probe.
   - The resident made no observed tool calls during more than ten hours of
     ordinary operation.
   - Thirty-seven near-duplicate repository-oriented learning pages were found
     in the resident's Mímir learning context.
3. Primary agent-system research and protocol documentation listed in
   [Research basis](#research-basis).

The live observations predate this branch and should remain labelled as
deployment evidence for that earlier image. The code findings below are
directly verifiable in this repository.

The root-cause sections describe the baseline that motivated the work. The
implemented behavior and final integration hardening are recorded below; they
should not be read as claims that those defects remain on this branch.

### Evidence standard

Claims in this document use the following evidence levels:

1. **Implemented:** a production adapter or runtime path exists.
2. **Mechanically tested:** deterministic tests prove transport, persistence,
   policy, or continuation mechanics. Scripted model output is valid here.
3. **Real dependency exercised:** the code used a real model, broker, cluster,
   workflow, peer, or sandbox for the operation being claimed.
4. **Deployed end to end:** the configured resident ran this branch and a real
   environmental event traversed the whole path.
5. **Behaviorally demonstrated:** repeated, non-canned runs show the model
   choosing when to research, ask, delegate, build, verify, and remember.

The branch reaches levels 1 and 2 for its deterministic mechanisms and level 4
for the local Laevateinn-to-Ivaldi judgment path. The accumulated live runs
reach level 3 for Nemotron, JetStream, Mímir, Yggdrasil directory/token
exchange, and Glitnir telemetry. The clean current run does not depend on
knowledge Mímir. It has not reached level 5, and the A2A build/adopt/reuse
trajectory has not been observed. Therefore this work cannot support a claim
of AGI-like operation or autonomous self-evolution.

### Local live proof on this branch

The local proof used `scripts/setups/configs/ivaldi-local-workshop.yaml` with a
local Ivaldi process and deployed dependencies. Laevateinn's machinery was
simulated, while its emitted events, broker retention and delivery, model
requests, tool calls, earlier diagnostic knowledge writes, authentication
exchanges, and telemetry were real. `environment.type: workshop` was used only
as an opaque configured provenance label. It can appear in raw source metadata
and runtime-owned outcome provenance, but does not select an adapter, handler,
tool, or decision path. It remains a configured string, never a closed runtime
enum.

Observed evidence includes:

- The `workshop-laevateinn-events` JetStream stream delivered retained raw
  connection, printer-status, connection-loss, error, and reconnection events
  through the configured generic NATS adapter and durable consumer.
- Nemotron produced the actual tool choices. No evaluator supplied canned tool
  results or expected scenario actions.
- The runtime attached authoritative Environment identity and correlation data
  after model output. A clean successful trace omitted those fields from the
  model prompt and outcome but retained them on the published judgment.
- Queue saturation rejected durable intake, causing the adapter to NAK and
  retry rather than ACK or forget the event. Shutdown retained the active task
  in the journal; restart resumed that exact task before pending work.
- Tempo contains the model and tool spans under the same trace, including trace
  `3c61ef9757fa395aab7d3c9e944ad01a` for a completed clean-contract judgment
  and `7eefd0e598dc21f2594700f115e4d934` for an interrupted task whose span closed
  with `ravn.task.outcome=interrupted`. Mimir accepted the corresponding Ravn
  metrics, grouped by task outcome and signal/tool dimensions.
- A repeated status case in the earlier diagnostic configuration explicitly
  searched and read a prior Mímir page before judging the observation. This
  proves retrieval and use, not that the stored conclusion was correct or
  broadly reusable. The clean configuration now sets `mimir.enabled: false`
  and exposes no Mímir tools to Ivaldi.
- Trace `5cd44ef60861372fa135416d665abd29` now contains redacted, bounded prompt,
  model-response, tool-request/result, judgment, resident-state, and Sleipnir
  event content. It shows Nemotron selecting a generic web search and then a
  `watch` judgment; no evaluator chose the tool or supplied its result.
- Trace `77e58033290d865b891a22d033bbaef8` captures an entire failed intake
  transaction: JetStream receive, neutral normalization, event publication,
  queue rejection with `queue_full`, error status, and JetStream NAK. The
  retained source event was not falsely acknowledged.
- Glitnir accepted the new runtime, queue, judgment, LLM/token, tool, signal,
  HTTP, resident, ODIN, and event-bus series. Every PromQL expression in the
  importable Valkyrie dashboard was executed against that live tenant without
  a query error, and its Tempo TraceQL query returned the resident traces.
- The local workload credential was verified as a real Eitri service-account
  token and rotated after its signing key/expiry made workload exchange fail.
  The replacement exchanged successfully at Yggdrasil, resolved the workshop
  build grant, and the read-only tool-build doctor passed configuration,
  backend, authentication, reachability, and live workflow discovery against
  the deployed **Tool & Skill Builder** Agent Card skill.
- Trace `9c0f7edcbb923abaeb5bf80d14ab13b4` records Nemotron independently choosing
  capability discovery, skill discovery, web research, and another capability
  lookup. The authenticated Observatory requests returned HTTP 200. The trace
  also records the interrupted process, durable restart, completed judgment,
  full working-state write, `sleep` disposition, publication, and ODIN handling.
  No `build_tool` call occurred, so this is evidence of model-directed research
  and restart continuity, not autonomous tool construction.

The run also exposed failures that remain part of the evidence:

- One Mímir write first failed because the model supplied a path outside the
  required Markdown contract. A later write succeeded but included an unknown
  date marker, so the note is weak evidence rather than trusted learning.
- Automatic episode reflection promoted unwarranted confidence from a single
  event. Local proof configuration now retains raw episodes but disables
  automatic reflection and automatic episode prefetch. Knowledge Mímir is
  absent from the clean Ivaldi baseline, not merely made explicit.
- A broader earlier persona wrote an empty `dummy.txt` while investigating. The
  local Ivaldi persona now exposes neither the source checkout nor direct file,
  shell, or todo tools. Environment access must come from configured real
  capabilities or the governed build path.
- A connection-loss case performed excessive Mímir, workspace, todo, and
  capability work and repeatedly updated one page instead of stopping. The
  task was interrupted, durably retained, and resumed after clarifying the
  generic tool-call/final-response protocol. It still wandered into tools that
  observed the source checkout rather than the workshop, so those misleading
  capabilities were removed from the configured persona and its turn budget
  was bounded.
- The clean resumed connection-loss trajectory terminated after one web search,
  but the search was generic and did not establish workshop-specific evidence.
  The model returned `signal_refs: []` despite the supplied required reference,
  and the parser still marked the judgment valid. It selected `continue`, but
  the continuation enqueue was rejected because the queue was full, so the
  resident disposition became `stop` while the task was recorded as success.
  The new trace makes those contradictions visible; they remain behavioral and
  contract/admission defects, not proof of a successful resident loop.

No `build_tool` call, completed A2A build, installed learned tool, or later
learned-tool reuse has yet occurred in an uncued real signal trajectory. That
claim remains deliberately open.

### 2026-07-21 durable-home and model-runtime comparison

The follow-up deliberately reused the existing ports and executor seam rather
than adding a planner, objectives service, or second resident framework.

Implemented runtime changes:

- `LocalResidentInbox` is a durable filesystem adapter behind the existing
  `ResidentInboxBackend`. Mímir is not required for resident continuity and is
  not replaced as a general knowledge system; inbox and resident-state storage
  remain separately configurable adapters.
- A JetStream observation is written to the resident inbox before source ACK.
  Persistence failure NAKs the message. The home trigger permits only one
  active/pending home wake, while later observations accumulate durably. Local
  retention prunes only processed history; it never drops an unconsumed
  observation to satisfy a count or age limit.
- A home turn receives bounded raw payload excerpts in addition to summaries
  and stable references. This closed a live failure where the model saw only a
  generic summary and searched an event UUID on the public web.
- Free-text `selected_next_action` is audit data, not executable work. The
  runtime no longer creates another model turn from prose such as "continue
  monitoring". Tool work must happen in the current turn; a later turn needs a
  real event, operator answer, or configured scheduled wake.
- Working state is a complete current snapshot with five named lists, bounded
  to five entries per list and 500 characters per entry. Invalid state cannot
  replace the last valid snapshot.
- Source trace context is persisted with inbox observations and carried into
  the coalesced home task. This is mechanically proven; the retained live event
  used for the runtime comparison predated that field, so the next newly
  ingested event remains the live proof of signal-to-home trace continuity.
- CLI-backed executors now create the same episode envelope used by resident
  completion. A valid Codex response can therefore update working state before
  inbox acknowledgement instead of being accepted only by the outer drive-loop
  parser.
- Codex app-server MCP elicitations now use the protocol's
  `{action, content}` response rather than an unrelated approval shape. With
  approval policy `never`, the configured Ravn MCP tool executes; interactive
  policies still surface the request through the existing control channel.
- CLI executor turns emit a real `chat <model>` span containing the exact
  bounded/redacted request, response, tool requests/results, token usage, and
  elapsed time. It does not invent stop reasons, private Codex reasoning
  iterations, or per-tool timing that app-server does not expose.

Live Nemotron evidence:

- Trace `78aa1ddee008d06143ad6cf3fb83af81` is a completed 222-second home turn
  over two real workshop observations. Once raw payloads were present, Nemotron
  correctly identified Sindri as connected and idle under a flaky simulator
  scenario, chose `watch`, persisted a complete working state, acknowledged
  both inbox records, and selected `sleep / external_event`. No synthetic
  continuation was queued; the next wake came only when another real
  JetStream event arrived.
- For the exact retained `connection lost` snapshot, trace
  `368838c0b26ad64b99b356ab9994d013` ran for 790 seconds. Nemotron made seven
  model calls, two capability-list calls, two skill-list calls, and one web
  fetch. Its initial outcome and one repair both encoded required arrays and
  working state as strings. The runtime rejected the judgment, retained the
  diagnostic turn, and left the observation unacknowledged. This is a model/
  runtime consistency failure caught by the harness, not a successful case.

Live Codex evidence:

- The comparison cloned the same queue journal, resident state, inbox record,
  and mandate, then disabled external intake in both clones. The Ravn case and
  Ravn capability surface were therefore identical. Codex app-server still
  adds its own native instructions, tools, and installed skill catalog, so the
  complete model-visible contexts are not byte-identical; this is a runtime
  comparison, not a controlled model benchmark.
- The first requested model name (`gpt-5.6`) was unsupported by the local
  ChatGPT-authenticated Codex account and was rejected. It is excluded from the
  behavioral comparison. The account's configured `gpt-5.6-sol` model was used
  for subsequent runs.
- The first successful model answer exposed the two harness defects described
  above: MCP approval was rejected by the wrong response shape, and the valid
  YAML was not attached to the resident episode. Both were fixed and the same
  untouched snapshot was replayed.
- Final trace `72fce3c8c07b5e74eb0fed4aa4097c9c` completed in 31.7 seconds. It
  includes the outer resident trace plus `chat gpt-5.6-sol`, exact
  `capability_list` request/result, final response, working-state write, inbox
  acknowledgement, judgment publication, and ODIN. Guild returned a real empty
  catalog with seven `observatory-unavailable` warnings. Codex recorded that as
  a capability gap, chose `watch / degraded / sleep / external_event`, and did
  not claim a diagnostic or reconnection action.

Live A2A discovery diagnosis:

- `ravn tool-build doctor` passes configuration, backend, authentication,
  reachability, and workflow discovery against the deployed Tool & Skill
  Builder. This confirms the vertical A2A build stack is real.
- General Guild discovery authenticates but currently returns zero agents.
  Noatun's Observatory directory answers and is empty; seven other
  Observatories are unavailable through Guild. The cluster ingresses showed
  that forwarded workload JWTs were rejected because Observatory Envoy
  accepted only the Keycloak provider.
- The Observatory chart now optionally accepts the configured workload issuer/
  JWKS and allows either identity provider. Helm lint and the chart test pass.
  This chart change has not been deployed, so the live empty peer catalog is
  still the truthful result and no general A2A trajectory is claimed.

The comparison supports a narrow conclusion: the durable/event harness can
carry the same real case through different model runtimes, and the tested Codex
runtime was much more consistent on this observation. It does not establish
that Codex is always better, that Nemotron cannot perform the role, or that the
resident is self-evolving. Those claims require distributions of uncued real
trajectories, including operator input, A2A delegation, a justified tool build,
verification, later reuse, and revision after feedback.

## Desired behavior

Given a mandate and an environment, the resident should be able to:

1. Notice new observations without requiring every signal type to be encoded as
   a runtime rule.
2. Form and revise hypotheses using local state, external research, memory, and
   peer capabilities.
3. Decide whether an observation is noise, evidence to retain, something to
   investigate, or grounds for action.
4. Recognize whether an unknown is:
   - a fact it can research,
   - operator intent it must ask for,
   - authority it does not possess,
   - a capability another agent has, or
   - a genuine missing tool.
5. Ask a precise question and resume the same case when the answer arrives.
6. Build the smallest missing capability when existing tools, skills,
   workflows, and agents do not suffice.
7. Verify the result of its action and use that feedback in later decisions.
8. Schedule future observation when time, rather than more immediate work, is
   the missing ingredient.
9. Share proven capabilities and learnings without treating unverified
   reflection as truth.

## What already works

| Mechanism | Current implementation | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Iterative tool loop | `src/ravn/agent.py::RavnAgent.run_turn` | Sound foundation. Tool results return to the model and tools can be registered during a turn. |
| Signal acquisition | `src/ravn/environment_signal_runtime.py` and configured signal adapters | Signals are normalized, published, deduplicated, and can be persisted with their source payload. |
| Capability catalog | `src/ravn/adapters/tools/capability_catalog.py` | Already unifies native tools, learned tools, skills, and configured workflows. |
| Learned-tool execution | `capability_list`, `learned_tool_run`, and dispatch injection mode | Keeps accumulated tools out of every prompt while preserving on-demand use. |
| Tool construction | `src/ravn/adapters/tools/build_tool.py` | Can author or commission, independently verify, review, canary, install, register, and propose a tool to a flock. |
| A2A workflow tasks | `src/ravn/adapters/tool_build/a2a.py` and Ting's A2A facade | Supports Agent Card discovery, stateful tasks, `INPUT_REQUIRED`, artifacts, and provenance for tool-building workflows. |
| Governance | permissions, ODIN, review items, trust modes, budgets, rollback | Correct place for deterministic authority and safety boundaries. |
| Human-help transport | generic `help_needed`/future `input_required`, resident operator state, Skuld pending requests, ForceReply correlation, and directed replies | Persist-before-surface, exact-peer routing with multiple waiting Valkyries, trace propagation, and same-case resume are mechanically tested; a deployed human question/answer trajectory remains unproven. |
| Resident state | `src/ravn/domain/resident_continuation.py`, `src/ravn/adapters/resident_state/`, and daemon wiring | Dynamically selected adapters now persist cases, working state, operator waits, answers, and bounded handoffs. |
| Long-term storage | Mímir pages, the local resident inbox, resident state, learning pages, and evidence artifacts | Continuity no longer depends on Mímir. Knowledge remains useful only when deliberately accessed and evidence-qualified. |

## Root causes

### 1. The outcome contract suppresses curiosity

`RavnAgent.run_turn` checks for an outcome block before executing tool calls when
`stop_on_outcome` is enabled. The runtime explicitly logs:

```text
Early termination: outcome block detected, skipping tool calls
```

The resident persona requires an outcome, and the idle-triage prompt supplies a
complete example beginning with `decision: watch`. Producing that block is
therefore the shortest successful response, while a response that combines a
draft judgment with evidence-gathering tool calls loses the tool calls.

This is an incentive and execution defect, not evidence that the model cannot
use tools.

### 2. Semantic intent is open-circuit

The outcome vocabulary includes `investigate`, `escalate`, `learn`, and
`propose_action`, but the generic `decision` is primarily validated, published,
and projected. ODIN reasons about attention tier, authority, and explicit action
proposals; it does not turn `decision: investigate` into another resident turn.

Nothing should add a hardcoded mapping such as:

```python
if decision == "investigate":
    enqueue_investigation()
```

Instead, the model must gather currently available evidence before finishing or
emit a generic selected next action for the existing continuation machinery.

### 3. The continuation kernel is unassembled

`src/ravn/domain/resident_continuation.py` already defines:

- `continue`, `ask_operator`, `sleep`, and `stop`
- selected action candidates
- turn records
- budget snapshots and limits
- policy decisions
- pending operator questions and answers
- a storage-neutral resident-state port

Mímir, GBrain, Letheo, and local state adapters implement much of the storage
contract. Tests exercise those adapters. The daemon never selects a resident
state adapter or invokes a continuation decision after a resident turn.

The missing resident agent is therefore already sketched in the domain layer.

### 4. The headless question path was open in the baseline

Native daemon agents are built with `user_input_fn=None`, so `ask_user` cannot
complete inside the turn. A persona may finish with `help_needed`, and Skuld can
deliver an answer to a connected peer, but the original native task has already
finished. A directed reply generally creates a new task with a new `Session`.

The branch now composes the missing mechanics: persist the operator-needed
record, emit one generic help event, retain exact Telegram ForceReply-to-peer
correlation in Skuld, direct the answer back to that peer, and enqueue the same
case with inherited trace context. This remains a mechanically tested path
until the shared Skuld room and resident image are deployed and a human reply
is observed end to end.

The required contract is:

1. Persist the current case and question.
2. Surface the question with a continuation identifier.
3. Accept an answer through an authenticated existing operator surface.
4. Resume the same case with the answer as an observation.
5. Mark the answer consumed.

### 5. Attention is allocated before the resident thinks

Per-signal tasks are admitted using configured severity values. Below-threshold
signals are placed into an in-memory `_untriaged` list and processed by a
periodic idle-triage task. The buffer is capped, emptied on each interval, and
lost on restart. Only a bounded sample is placed in the prompt.

Signals are also written to the durable resident inbox, but idle triage does not
read that inbox or maintain a durable consumption cursor.

Severity admission is valid as throughput control. It must not be mistaken for
the resident's semantic judgment. Routine attention should come from durable
windows the model evaluates, with urgent source-declared signals allowed to
wake it immediately.

### 6. Capability absence is decided by an exact-name fast path

`ResidentLearningRuntime.process_signal` derives an exact capability name:

```text
inspect.<event namespace>.<kind>.<reason>
```

It executes an exact installed match or reports
`defer_to_investigation_with_build_tool` before the model sees the signal. It can
also publish a judgment with a fixed confidence value.

An exact-name miss does not establish a capability gap. A generic tool, skill,
workflow, peer agent, or composition of capabilities may already solve the
problem. The lookup result should be supplied as an observation or hint, not as
the resident's decision.

### 7. Procedural recipes compete with model judgment

The environment signal prompt and Valkyrie personas prescribe sequences such
as `capability_list`, `skill_list`, `skill_run`, `learned_tool_run`, then
`build_tool`. The generic agent loop additionally contains domain-drive-specific
rules that reject questions and responses until exact file tools have run and a
particular file has been written.

Personas should define identity, charter, evidence expectations, output
contract, and authority boundaries. The generic runtime should not enforce a
domain-specific investigative recipe.

### 8. Prompt state is shared across agents

The daemon creates one mutable `PromptBuilder` before defining the per-task
agent factory and passes that builder to every agent. Each agent mutates the
builder's identity, memory, and learning sections.

Concurrent tasks, or multiple task personas created in an unfortunate order,
can therefore render the wrong identity or context. This can directly produce
confused environmental understanding.

Each agent must own its builder. Only immutable cache data may be shared.

### 9. Useful tools exist but are persona-gated

The workshop resident has local shell/file tools, workflows, skills, learned
tools, and Mímir. Platform cron tools can create future turns, and web and todo
tools exist, but they are absent from the current persona tool allowance.

Cron requires the exact tool names `cron_create`, `cron_list`, and
`cron_delete`; `cron` is not currently a group alias.

Scheduling is temporal agency, not learning by itself. A scheduled observation
only becomes useful learning when the later result is assessed and the schedule
is retained, changed, or deleted accordingly.

### 10. Mímir is in the cognition path instead of behind it

Mímir currently has several conflicting roles:

- raw signal archive
- resident inbox
- resident continuation store
- free-form wiki
- automatic reflection destination
- automatically injected learning context
- entity-pointer reflex
- explicit model-invoked search and read tools

The helpful roles are durable storage and deliberate retrieval. The harmful
roles are automatic attention and automatic truth.

The post-session reflection prompt assumes a coding session and asks for a
repository-specific learning. A resident with no repository slug writes those
pages under `learnings/general/`. Session-start injection passes only
`repo_slug`; it does not pass the resident environment, domain, or flock to the
learning selector. General and shared pages are selected by recency and injected
before the resident has judged the current case.

The entity reflex can similarly turn capitalized word matches into unsolicited
context. That may help a curated knowledge base, but it amplifies a contaminated
one.

The correct rule is:

> Mímir is the resident's disk, not its consciousness.

Use Mímir for:

- raw signals and evidence
- explicit case and turn records
- pending questions and answers
- completed investigation artifacts
- adopted tools and skills with provenance
- learnings supported by external outcomes or repeated evidence

Do not use Mímir for:

- current working state reconstructed through fuzzy search
- automatic injection of recent reflections
- deciding what deserves attention
- treating every completed session as a reusable learning
- silently steering behavior through entity-name matches

### 11. A2A is implemented vertically, not generally

Ting exposes workflows as A2A Agent Card skills, and the A2A tool-build backend
can launch, follow, answer questions, handle gates, and retrieve artifacts. The
platform also exposes an A2A Agent Directory through Observatory and Guild.

Ravn does not project those discovered Agent Card skills into its ordinary
capability catalog or expose a general stateful A2A task tool. A2A is therefore
available for commissioned tool builds but not as a general model-selected
collaboration mechanism.

### 12. Tests prove plumbing, not judgment

The investigation-loop test scripts the LLM to call `build_tool`. The ask-user
test scripts the LLM to ask. These tests correctly prove mechanics but do not
show that a real model can decide among:

- ignore
- inspect locally
- research externally
- reuse an existing capability
- ask for operator intent
- delegate to another agent
- build a missing capability
- wait and observe later

Until live behavioral evaluation covers those choices, model capability and
harness quality remain confounded.

### 13. Learned-tool autonomy lacks a hard runtime wall

Independent verification establishes that a tool satisfies its tests; it does
not establish that the implementation is benign. Environment scrubbing does not
prevent same-user file access, and the local backend does not provide network
isolation.

Broad autonomous tool creation must remain bounded by declared reach, review,
scoped credentials, and current trust levels until the existing runner boundary
can enforce filesystem and network reach in a container or pod-per-run runtime.

### Model-owned decisions

The model decides:

- what the current observations mean
- what evidence is missing
- which hypotheses remain plausible
- whether evidence can be gathered locally
- whether another agent or workflow is better situated
- whether uncertainty concerns fact, intent, authority, or capability
- whether a new tool is justified
- whether to act, ask, wait, or finish

### Runtime-owned invariants

The runtime controls:

- authentication, permissions, and authority
- budgets, timeouts, and concurrency
- input/output schemas and protocol validity
- durable task state and continuation
- idempotency, deduplication, and replay
- tool verification and canaries
- runtime containment
- audit, provenance, and rollback

Hardcoding these invariants is necessary. Hardcoding the investigative path is
not.

### Working state

The active case should contain a compact model-visible state document:

- mandate or objective
- observations with evidence references
- current hypotheses and alternatives
- important unknowns
- actions attempted and their results
- pending question, review, or delegated task
- selected next action
- completion condition

This is explicit state, not hidden chain-of-thought. It should be persisted
through the existing resident turn/state contract and loaded deterministically.
It must not be reconstructed by asking Mímir for vaguely similar pages.

### The resident home turn

Routine autonomy should use one recurring resident wake over a durable window:

1. Load unconsumed resident-inbox references since the prior wake.
2. Load the last resident turn record and any unresolved selected action,
   operator question, peer task, or review.
3. Present bounded summaries and stable evidence references.
4. Let the model retrieve full evidence with explicit tools.
5. Let the normal tool loop run until the model produces a final outcome with no
   pending tool calls.
6. Persist the turn, selected action, evidence, and consumption cursor.

Source-declared urgent signals may still create immediate turns. The home turn
is the primary attention allocator for routine observations.

## Repair plan

The plan intentionally starts with a clean behavioral experiment. It does not
implement the full target architecture before determining what the deployed
model can do with a correct harness.

### Phase 0: Open the cage and establish a baseline

**Goal:** Remove mechanisms that suppress or contaminate judgment, then observe
the real model using the existing tool loop.

#### 0.1 Execute tool calls before accepting an outcome

- Remove the early branch that skips tool calls when an outcome block accompanies
  `TOOL_USE`.
- Treat outcome text accompanying tool calls as a draft. Execute the calls,
  return their observations, and require a subsequent final response.
- Keep normal completion when the model returns a final response without tool
  calls.

**Proof:** A deterministic test returns an outcome block and a tool call in the
same response. The tool executes, its result enters history, and the model gets
another iteration before completion.

#### 0.2 Isolate prompt state per agent

- Construct a `PromptBuilder` inside the task agent factory.
- Share only the underlying immutable/cache facility if useful.
- Remove the duplicate trust-filter application while touching the factory.

**Proof:** Two concurrent agents with different personas and memory contexts
each receive only their own identity and context.

#### 0.3 Remove answer-shaped defaults

- Replace the idle-triage example's prefilled `decision: watch` and watching
  state with a neutral schema/example that requires a choice.
- Reduce the resident persona to charter, evidence discipline, capability
  descriptions, authority boundaries, and outcome contract.
- Remove persona-specific reasoning enforcement from the generic agent loop.

**Proof:** Prompt snapshot tests contain the allowed outcome vocabulary but no
default operational conclusion or mandatory tool sequence.

#### 0.4 Remove Mímir from automatic cognition

- Disable post-session learning reflection for the workshop resident.
- Disable automatic `learnings_context` injection for the experiment.
- Disable the entity retrieval reflex for the experiment.
- Quarantine contaminated learning pages under an auditable archive location;
  do not irreversibly delete them as part of the baseline change.
- Continue recording raw signals and explicit evidence.
- Keep `mimir_search` and `mimir_read` available for deliberate model use.

**Proof:** Prompt composition shows no automatic Mímir learning or entity
context, while the model can still retrieve a referenced page with a tool call.

#### 0.5 Expose the honest tool surface

- Add web research, todo, and the exact cron tool names to the workshop
  resident's allowed tools.
- Make `build_tool` an ordinary permissioned capability for authorized resident
  tasks instead of attaching it only when `triggered_by` begins with `signal:`.
- Preserve permission, trust, review, and reach gates.

**Proof:** `capability_list` and the actual API tool definitions agree about what
the resident can invoke in the live task.

#### 0.6 Run the first real judgment observation

Run the deployed resident repeatedly on retained or newly arriving events from
its real environment. Do not inject authored events, substitute tool results,
or replace a dependency with a fake. Wait for the relevant situation when the
environment has not produced it yet:

1. a complete observation requiring no research
2. an observation requiring local inspection
3. an observation requiring current web research
4. a problem solved by an existing workflow or learned tool
5. ambiguity requiring operator intent
6. a condition best handled by a scheduled recheck

Capture the complete trajectory: broker metadata and raw reference, prompt
composition, real tool requests and results, durable case records, outcome,
cost, and elapsed time. Evaluate a distribution of behavior across repeated
observations; do not require one deterministic action sequence from the model.

**Phase exit:** The resident no longer drops selected actions or injects known
contamination. The live report distinguishes model behavior from runtime
behavior with auditable traces.

### Phase 1: Wire durable resident continuity

**Goal:** Give the resident a recurring home turn and reliable
continue/ask/sleep/stop behavior without adding an objectives subsystem.

#### 1.1 Compose the existing resident-state port

- Build the configured preferred and fallback resident-state adapters in the
  daemon composition root.
- Select them using the existing adapter selector.
- Inject the selected `ResidentStatePort` into the drive loop or resident task
  execution path.
- Do not branch on Mímir, GBrain, Letheo, or local adapter types.

#### 1.2 Persist every resident turn

- Parse the structured outcome once.
- Create a `ResidentTurnRecord` with tool names, usage, outcome, evidence, and
  `selected_action_from_outcome`.
- Persist the turn and budget snapshot through `ResidentStatePort`.
- Preserve the originating root correlation id in the record or case metadata.

#### 1.3 Continue generic selected actions

- If the model selects an immediately executable next action, assess it through
  the existing permission/autonomy boundary and the resident run budget.
- Enqueue a continuation carrying the same case/root correlation and the prior
  turn record.
- Do not translate semantic judgment enums into task types.
- Stop when there is no selected action, the model chooses stop/sleep, or a
  budget/authority boundary intervenes.

#### 1.4 Complete the operator question round trip

- Persist `operator-needed/latest` before surfacing the question.
- Emit a runtime-neutral `input_required` event with the run, case, and
  continuation identifiers. During migration, the current `help_needed` event
  is the wire-compatible precursor.
- Let Ravn's configured Skuld room adapter project it into a shared room.
- Let Skuld deliver it through its configured Telegram channel and retain the
  outbound ForceReply message id so replies route correctly even when multiple
  Valkyries are waiting.
- Write the free-text operator answer through `ResidentStatePort`.
- Enqueue the same case, load the answer as an observation, and mark it consumed
  only after successful resume.
- Keep Skuld and Telegram outside Ravn's judgment domain. They are concrete
  Niuu room infrastructure behind Ravn ports, not separate continuation
  semantics.

#### 1.5 Drive the home turn from the durable inbox

- Read `ResidentInboxStatus.NEW` records up to a configured wake bound.
- Include bounded summaries plus exact Mímir evidence references.
- Let the model explicitly read selected records.
- Mark records consumed/attached only after the resident turn is durably
  recorded.
- Recover cleanly after daemon restart without losing or repeating acknowledged
  observations.
- Keep urgent per-event wakes as an admission-control optimization.

#### 1.6 Do not implement the dormant objective configuration

The home case, selected next action, todo tools, and cron tools cover the first
real requirement. Leave `create_objectives`,
`attach_to_existing_objectives`, and related fields unused during this phase;
remove or formally deprecate them after compatibility review rather than
building a speculative objective engine.

**Phase exit:** The resident can inspect, ask, receive an answer, resume the same
case, schedule a later wake, survive restart, and stop within its budgets.

### Phase 2: Let the resident discover and use other agents

**Goal:** Make A2A a normal capability choice rather than a tool-build-only
backend.

#### 2.1 Project Agent Card skills into the existing catalog

- Use Observatory/Guild's existing A2A Agent Directory as a capability source.
- Represent each discovered Agent Card skill in the current portable capability
  catalog with source, endpoint, input modes, auth requirements, freshness, and
  provenance metadata.
- Do not create a second agent inventory or ontology.

#### 2.2 Add one stateful A2A task tool

Expose the existing A2A client mechanics through one permissioned tool with
operations such as:

- `start`
- `get`
- `reply`
- `cancel`

The tool must preserve A2A task ids, `INPUT_REQUIRED`, artifacts, and
provenance. The model chooses the remote skill and supplies the task prompt.

#### 2.3 Turn exact capability lookup into evidence

- Retain cheap deterministic matching as a candidate/hint source.
- Stop publishing a resident judgment from the exact-match fast path.
- Let the model compare native tools, learned tools, skills, workflows, and
  remote Agent Card skills before declaring a capability gap.

**Phase exit:** In a controlled case where a peer has the best capability, the
resident discovers it, delegates, follows the task, handles a question, and
uses the returned artifact or evidence in its own final judgment.

### Phase 3: Reintroduce learning only when feedback supports it

**Goal:** Restore useful long-term memory without allowing reflection noise to
steer the resident.

#### 3.1 Separate records from learnings

- A completed turn is a record, not automatically a learning.
- A reflection is a candidate, not automatically trusted context.
- A reusable learning requires external feedback, a verified outcome, repeated
  evidence, or an explicit reviewed promotion.

#### 3.2 Retrieve deliberately

- Keep current case state deterministic.
- Prefer explicit evidence references from the inbox, prior turn, tool result,
  or peer artifact.
- Let the model invoke Mímir search/read when historical context may change the
  decision.
- If automatic retrieval is reintroduced, test it independently and inject
  pointers rather than bodies by default.

#### 3.3 Measure memory value

Run the same behavioral cases with:

1. no Mímir retrieval
2. deliberate model-invoked retrieval
3. any proposed automatic retrieval

Compare correctness, unnecessary actions, prompt size, cost, latency, and
contamination. Do not enable automatic retrieval unless it improves the
measured result.

**Phase exit:** Recalled knowledge improves repeated-case performance without
raising false-positive actions or suppressing new evidence.

### Phase 4: Enforce learned-tool reach at runtime

**Goal:** Widen autonomy only after the runtime can enforce what a generated
tool is allowed to touch.

- Reuse the existing learned-tool runner boundary.
- Add a container or pod-per-run execution adapter with enforced filesystem,
  network, credential, resource, and timeout policy.
- Keep declared reach, independent verification, canaries, ODIN review, audit,
  and rollback.
- Treat declaration/review as governance and runtime containment as the actual
  security boundary.

**Phase exit:** A tool cannot exceed its granted reach even if its implementation
is faulty or adversarial.

#### Implemented containment boundary

The production default is now `learned_tool_execution_backend: container`.
Each invocation gets a new digest-pinned OCI container with a read-only root,
no Linux capabilities, `no-new-privileges`, PID/CPU/memory limits, bounded
scratch space, and a hard timeout. It receives only the tool file (read-only)
plus exact filesystem and credential grants. Networking is off by default.

The adapter deliberately refuses grants Docker cannot faithfully express:
target-specific egress, read-only/write-only sockets, filesystem write-only,
runtime sockets, and host pseudo-filesystems. Broad network access must be
declared as `network/read_write` and therefore enters the existing mutating
review path. Dependency provisioning runs separately with only the tool venv
and package cache mounted; the resulting environment is read-only during tool
execution. Failure to start the container is an error, never a local fallback.

The previous `local` and workspace-mounted `forge`/`devrunner` runners remain
explicit compatibility modes. They are no longer the default and make no claim
to provide this boundary.

The live adversarial proof executes a tool that attempts undeclared host-file
read, self-modification, and network access, then repeats with exact read,
read-write, and credential grants. The first three operations are blocked; only
the explicitly mounted paths and named credential become visible.

## Implementation status

| Phase | Code/test status | Live status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — clean judgment baseline | Mechanically tested | Locally exercised with real retained events and Nemotron; one clean judgment completed, while other trajectories showed unnecessary work and repetition |
| 1 — durable resident continuity | Mechanically tested, including persist-before-ACK, coalesced wakes, exact multi-peer Skuld reply routing, trace propagation, and operator resume | Local shutdown/restart retained and resumed the active case; real observations accumulated behind one wake and were acknowledged only after valid state; deployed operator question/answer has not been live-proven |
| 2 — general A2A collaboration | Mechanically tested against protocol fixtures; Observatory workload-identity chart fix is linted but undeployed | Live Agent Card, token exchange, and tool-builder discovery work; general Guild discovery returns an empty catalog plus seven unavailable peers, and no uncued complete A2A task/build trajectory has occurred |
| 3 — evidence-gated learning | Mechanically tested | Earlier explicit Mímir write/read occurred, but quality was weak; clean Ivaldi now disables knowledge Mímir and no reliable behavior improvement is established |
| 4 — enforced learned-tool reach | Container and optional Kubernetes mechanisms tested | Ivaldi is configured for the unenforced `local` backend |
| 5 — delivery and trust hardening | Mechanically tested | Local authenticated platform exchange and Glitnir export exercised; cluster deployment of this branch remains pending |

### Final integration hardening

The final stitch deliberately adds no planner or objective service:

- Resident continuation persists the exact durable turn, but supplies later
  model turns with the current complete working-state snapshot plus a bounded
  handoff of the selected action, relevant tool results, and evidence
  references. It no longer nests the full prior prompt and response on every
  cycle. The durable turn remains retrievable by reference when its detail can
  change the decision. Operator-needed markers retain the reference and resume
  through the same bounded handoff.
- The model owns `observations`, `hypotheses`, `unknowns`, `capability_gaps`,
  and `attempts`. Runtime code validates only that all five sections form a
  complete snapshot; malformed or truncated state cannot replace the last
  valid snapshot, and the runtime does not synthesize missing content.
- Generic outcome parsing retains a structurally valid YAML mapping when the
  lossy soft-wrap fallback has an equal validation error count. Missing
  optional fields no longer make that fallback look preferable. This prevents
  a complete object such as working state from being silently flattened into
  a string before resident validation.
- Continuation timing is explicit model output, but free-text model intent never
  self-queues work. Tools execute in the current bounded turn; external events,
  configured scheduled wakes, and operator answers are the only sources of a
  later turn. `sleep`, `ask_operator`, and `stop` determine disposition, while
  missing or incoherent timing fails closed. This is control-plane validation,
  not environment-specific decision logic.
- An outcome that remains schema-invalid after the single repair attempt is
  retained as a diagnostic turn and published only as a rejection. It cannot
  replace working state or enqueue a continuation. This closes a live-observed
  fail-open path where publication was rejected but transport had still acted
  on the malformed model fields.
- JetStream messages remain pending until raw publication, resident processing,
  and durable task-window enqueue all succeed. Success ACKs the batch; any
  failure NAKs it and does not poison the process-local dedupe cache.
- Durable transports create one neutral observation window for the model to
  judge. Severity remains source metadata and wake/admission information, not
  the resident's semantic decision.
- Automatic Mímir signal mirroring is now opt-in. Post-session reflection is
  session-neutral, includes structured work context when present, refuses to
  infer subject-matter learning from bookkeeping, and still writes only
  evidence-gated candidates.
- General A2A calls validate the Agent Card/interface origin, bind bearer
  clients to configured trusted origins, bound inbound/outbound model context,
  and preserve task, question, gate, artifact, and provenance identifiers.
- The optional `k8s_job` learned-tool backend verifies the live deny and allow
  NetworkPolicy specifications before every Job. The agent chart installs the
  matching least-privilege RBAC and policies. Jobs use a digest-pinned image,
  no service-account token, denied ingress, non-root/seccomp/capability
  restrictions, resource and output bounds, and fail closed for reach the
  backend cannot enforce.
- `KubernetesJobLearnedToolRunner.verify()` is now implemented
  (`supports_verify = True`), closing the gap where peer-proposal adoption
  raised loudly on `k8s_job` instead of completing. A peer's test suite runs
  in the SAME denied-network, NetworkPolicy-verified Job shape `execute()`
  uses. A peer proposal that declares requirements is declined outright, the
  same posture `execute()` takes at invocation time — installing them would
  need a throwaway Job with real egress for a tool that could never actually
  run with those requirements on this backend anyway; the container runner
  keeps installing (binary wheels only), but a requirement string is now
  parsed with `packaging.requirements.Requirement` and refused whenever it
  is a direct URL/VCS/local-path reference, since `--only-binary=:all:`
  alone does not stop pip from building one of those from source.
  `CapabilityProposal`'s own requirement validator already rejected the same
  shapes structurally (confirmed by test), so a malicious peer proposal is
  declined at parse time independent of this defense-in-depth check.
  - Two budgets are deliberately decoupled: a separate,
    `job_pod_start_timeout_seconds`-bounded window covers scheduling and
    image pull, while the test's own timeout only starts counting once the
    container's `state.running.startedAt` is observed — so a slow pull
    never eats into the test's run time. `activeDeadlineSeconds` on the Job
    covers both budgets combined.
  - An API error, an image pull failure, an unschedulable pod, a kubelet
    admission refusal (`OutOfcpu`/`NodeAffinity` — diagnosed by the
    container's actual state, never by pod `phase` alone), or the container
    never starting within its pod-start window all raise
    `LearnedToolInfrastructureError`. A cluster-driven eviction (node
    drain, preemption, the taint-manager) does too — but an eviction caused
    by the pod's OWN resource usage (its ephemeral-storage/emptyDir volume
    or memory exceeding its limit) is a failed verification, not
    infrastructure, so a peer cannot force endless retries by writing past
    its own limit.
  - A test that hangs past the timeout AFTER its container has started is a
    durable failed verification, never infrastructure: a peer whose tests
    hang must be rejected once, not retried forever on redelivery because
    every attempt "looks like" an outage.
  - For a denied-network Job (verify(), and run() of a tool without network
    reach), every NetworkPolicy in the namespace is enumerated (not only
    the two verified by name, and evaluated against every selector operator
    — In/NotIn/Exists/DoesNotExist, failing closed on anything else) to
    catch an unrelated policy that also grants denied pods egress —
    NetworkPolicies are additive, so a namespace-wide "allow DNS" policy
    would otherwise silently widen what the deny policy appeared to
    enforce. Skipped for an allowed-network `execute()` call, which has
    nothing for the check to protect and would otherwise need the `list`
    RBAC verb unconditionally. The deny/allow policies themselves must now
    have a selector of exactly `{matchLabels: {label: value}}` — no extra
    labels or `matchExpressions` that would select fewer than all
    learned-tool pods carrying that label. Cluster-level policy layers
    (`AdminNetworkPolicy`, Cilium, Calico) are not enumerated.
  - Each Job's Secret now carries an `ownerReference` to that Job (its real
    server-assigned UID, so the Job is created before the Secret), a third
    garbage-collection backstop behind the explicit post-run delete and the
    Job's own TTL.
  `ForgeSandboxLearnedToolRunner` (the legacy Docker-daemon-dependent
  `forge`/`devrunner` backend) still has no `verify()`; peer adoption on it
  continues to raise rather than silently falling back to host-side
  verification.
- OpenTelemetry now follows the causal path through signal adapters, JetStream
  receive/ACK/NAK, queue admission, model turns, tool calls, capability
  discovery, authenticated HTTP and workload exchange, A2A tasks, build/
  verify/review/canary/register phases, resident-state ports, Sleipnir
  publishers/subscribers and operator handlers, and ODIN. Content capture is
  explicit, redacted, and bounded. Per-task identifiers stay in traces and are
  excluded from metric labels.
- An importable Grafana dashboard covers liveness, queues, task outcomes,
  judgments, LLM/token use, tools, capabilities, durable signal handoff,
  external dependencies, A2A/tool evolution, resident/ODIN decisions,
  operator activity, and direct Tempo trace search. Its PromQL and TraceQL were
  executed against the live Glitnir tenant; deployment into the separately
  managed Grafana release remains a GitOps step.

Mímir is intentionally outside the automatic judgment path. Configurations may
expose it as an agent-invoked evidence store/search tool, but clean Ivaldi
baseline disables it entirely. Candidate reflections cannot enter trusted
retrieval until repeated or externally verified evidence promotes them.
Reintroduction of either explicit or automatic recall is an evaluation
decision, not a runtime default.

## Final validation record

Validation on 2026-07-20 covered the integrated implementation across Ravn,
legacy Ravn units, Niuu/Guild, Observatory, Sleipnir, Ting, Skuld, charts, and
the wider repository. The final repository-wide run after the local proof and
telemetry/dashboard hardening reported:

- `17339 passed, 26 skipped, 129 deselected, 1 xfailed` in `326.36s` in the
  repository-wide pytest run.
- Ruff passed repository-wide; the agent chart passed Helm lint and rendered
  the matching runtime configuration, RBAC, and NetworkPolicies.
- The dashboard JSON parsed successfully. Every dashboard PromQL expression
  returned a successful response from the live Glitnir Mimir tenant, and its
  TraceQL expression returned the live Ivaldi traces from Tempo.
- The live Docker containment proof passed against the pinned multi-architecture
  devrunner digest. An adversarial learned tool could not read an undeclared
  host file, modify its own code, or open an undeclared network connection;
  exact read, read-write, and named credential grants remained usable.
- Deterministic end-to-end cases cover durable continuation, operator
  question/resume, budgets, A2A discovery and `INPUT_REQUIRED` continuation,
  JetStream ACK/NAK handoff, evidence-gated learning promotion, Kubernetes
  policy verification, and deliberate trusted retrieval.

The 2026-07-21 durable-home/runtime-neutral follow-up completed a fresh
repository-wide run: `17363 passed, 26 skipped, 129 deselected, 1 xfailed` in
`348.84s`. The changed Python surface passed Ruff, the Observatory chart passed
Helm lint, and focused resident/Codex/workload-identity verification passed
`310` tests. Inbox retention tests now also prove that neither the local nor
Mímir adapter prunes an unconsumed observation to satisfy count or age limits.

This validates runtime mechanisms, not model judgment or deployed integration.
Scripted model output remains appropriate for mechanism tests, but it is not
evidence that a model will select those mechanisms.

The bounded-continuation follow-up passed the combined `tests/test_niuu` and
`tests/test_ravn` suites on the same date (`5353 passed, 1 skipped`). A real
resumed online event produced a
complete five-section state and chose `sleep / external_event`, reducing the
durable queue without creating another continuation. The same turn still
returned an empty `signal_refs` list despite the supplied event reference; that
provenance/contract defect remains open and is visible in the trace and turn
record.

A later real event selected capability discovery followed by an immediate
diagnostic fetch. Its first state encoded empty sections as nested empty lists,
and its repair remained invalid. The run exposed that the rejected outcome was
still able to enqueue transport work. The invalid continuation was removed from
the proof queue, and the runtime now fails closed as described above. The
original journal was retained as
`queue-evolution-proof-4.before-invalid-continuation-removal.json` for audit.

### Invalidated behavioral evaluation

An earlier revision of this branch reported a **6/9** Nemotron score. That
number is withdrawn. Although the LLM requests reached the real configured
Nemotron endpoint, every environmental event was authored inside the evaluator
and every tool, including `build_tool` and `a2a_task`, returned fixed canned
output. The evaluator therefore tested model choices over a fabricated tool
surface; it did not exercise NATS, the deployed resident, an actual tool build,
an A2A peer, operator continuation, or later learning. Shipping that evaluator
under `src/ravn/evals` also violated the repository rule against demo-only or
fake runtime paths outside tests. The evaluator and its claims have been
removed.

### A2A deployment already present

The A2A platform is not hypothetical. A live request to
`https://yggdrasil.niuu.world/.well-known/agent-card.json` returned the dynamic
Ting Agent Card with seven workflow skills, including **Tool & Skill Builder**,
and advertised the authenticated JSON-RPC endpoint
`https://yggdrasil.niuu.world/api/v1/ting/a2a`. The endpoint and the Guild and
Observatory directory routes are live behind workload/JWT authentication.

The checked-in Ymir deployment runs the A2A workflow surface with Ting, Guild,
and Observatory. Ivaldi's `8ef150ed` image contains the real
`A2AToolBuildBackend`, gate/question reviewer, and `build_tool`. Its runtime
attaches `build_tool` automatically to `signal:*` tasks and the Ivaldi config
points that backend at Yggdrasil's live Agent Card and the Valhalla connection.
Therefore a running Ivaldi on that image can commission a real A2A tool-builder
workflow from a signal turn.

What is new and still undeployed on this branch is **general** model-selected
A2A collaboration: the `a2a_task` tool and Guild-backed directory client used
for arbitrary peer discovery, start/follow/reply/cancel behavior. That is
separate from the already deployed vertical A2A tool-build path.

### Deployment gap found during the audit

The checked-in Ivaldi manifest currently has `replicas: 0` and references image
commit `8ef150ed`. That image diverged before the continuation, general A2A,
evidence-gating, and runtime-reach commits on this branch. Even if this branch
were deployed unchanged, its current persona/configuration would still leave
the central loop open:

- The outcome schema has no `selected_next_action`, `continuation`, `question`,
  or `verdict: help_needed`. `ResidentRuntime` therefore sees no action to
  continue and no operator request to persist.
- The deployed `8ef150ed` runtime attaches `build_tool` to signal tasks even
  though the persona does not allow it explicitly. This branch deliberately
  replaces that trigger-name special case with ordinary persona permission.
  Deploying this branch without adding `build_tool` to Ivaldi's allowed tools
  would therefore regress access to the already deployed A2A build backend.
- Direct web research and self-scheduling are also absent: the persona allows
  neither `web_search`/`web_fetch` nor `cron_create`/`cron_list`/`cron_delete`.
  A remote workflow may provide research, but no such use has been observed.
- The persona exposes `a2a_task` indirectly through the `ravn` alias on this
  branch, but Ivaldi's current image predates that general client.
- `resident_inbox.environment_signals_enabled` remains at its default `false`,
  so the durable resident home turn has no environmental inbox to consume.
- Learned tools are configured to run with the `local` compatibility backend,
  which explicitly provides no filesystem or network boundary. The new
  `k8s_job` enforcement path is not configured for Ivaldi.
- No shared Skuld operator room is configured for Ivaldi, so a persisted
  question cannot currently reach the owner through the existing Telegram
  integration or return to the resident.

These are configuration and deployment integration gaps, not evidence that the
model is incapable. They do mean the system, as presently configured, cannot
demonstrate the claimed self-directed loop.

### Smallest honest route to an end-to-end result

Do not add another evaluator or orchestration layer. Close and prove the
existing path in this order:

1. Build and deploy this branch for Ivaldi, run one replica, and record the
   immutable image digest and effective configuration.
2. Align Ivaldi's contract with `ResidentRuntime`: expose
   `selected_next_action`, `continuation`, `question`, and `help_needed`; allow
   `build_tool`, web research, and the exact cron tools; enable the durable
   environment inbox; connect it to the shared Skuld operator room; and use the
   enforced `k8s_job` learned-tool backend.
3. Inspect the effective tool catalog from the running resident. A prompt claim
   is not evidence that a tool exists; `capability_list` and the API tool
   definitions must agree.
4. Consume a real retained or newly arriving workshop event through the real
   JetStream durable. Preserve its broker sequence, raw reference, case id,
   model trajectory, tool results, turn record, and ACK state.
5. Let Nemotron choose what to do. Score evidence use, unnecessary work,
   authority violations, and whether later observations revise the judgment.
   Do not score exact prose or require a single preselected action sequence.
6. When a genuine operator-intent gap occurs, observe the resident persist one
   question, accept a real answer, and resume the same case and parent turn.
7. When a genuine capability gap occurs, observe the resident discover the
   absence, commission the real A2A tool-builder workflow, handle any real
   `INPUT_REQUIRED` state, retrieve and verify the artifact, run it in the
   enforced backend, and use its output on the case.
8. Observe at least one real non-build A2A delegation through a discovered
   Agent Card, including task state, artifacts, and failure behavior.
9. Demonstrate learning only when a later independent event causes the
   resident to retrieve and reuse a proven note, tool, schedule, or peer more
   effectively. A stored reflection by itself is not learning.
10. Repeat over time and report distributions and failures. The model is
    stochastic; deterministic code should enforce safety, durability, and
    provenance, not pretend to make judgment deterministic.

The acceptance artifact is an auditable set of real trajectories, not a score
over canned scenarios. Until steps 1–9 have each been observed at least once,
the accurate product statement is: **the branch provides candidate agency
mechanisms, not a demonstrated self-evolving agent.**

## File-level implementation map

| Area | Likely files | Intended change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tool/outcome loop | `src/ravn/agent.py` | Execute tools before accepting a final outcome; remove domain-specific process enforcement. |
| Agent construction | `src/ravn/cli/daemon_runtime.py` | Per-agent prompt builder; compose resident state; remove duplicate trust filter. |
| Signal windows | `src/ravn/environment_signal_runtime.py` | Neutral outcome template; move routine attention from volatile buffer to durable inbox. |
| Durable inbox | `src/ravn/resident_inbox/` | Load and durably acknowledge wake windows; preserve evidence references. |
| Continuation domain | `src/ravn/domain/resident_continuation.py` | Reuse existing types; extend only where correlation/case metadata is genuinely missing. |
| Resident-state adapters | `src/ravn/adapters/resident_state/` | Reuse preferred/fallback selection and question/answer storage. |
| Runtime contract | Ravn-owned model/executor ports and canonical run events | Normalize direct models and agentic runtimes such as Codex and Claude Code beneath Ravn without giving them ownership of resident judgment or learning. |
| Niuu collaboration adapters | Flokk mesh, Skuld room, identity, and deployment composition | Implement Ravn-facing infrastructure ports without moving semantic decisions out of Ravn. |
| Operator path | resident continuation plus Skuld room/channel adapters | Surface and answer one persisted continuation contract; correlate a reply to the exact peer/run and trace. |
| Reflection | `src/ravn/adapters/reflection/post_session.py` | Disable for baseline; later make session-neutral and evidence-gated. |
| Mímir reflex | `src/ravn/reflex.py`, Ravn configuration | Disable for baseline; reintroduce only with measured benefit. |
| Persona | resident persona configuration/YAML | Short charter; enable exact web/todo/cron tools; remove procedural recipe. |
| Tool evolution | `src/ravn/cli/runtime_builders.py`, `src/ravn/adapters/tools/build_tool.py` | Make build capability available based on permission, not trigger string. |
| Capability catalog | `src/ravn/domain/capability_catalog.py`, `src/ravn/adapters/tools/capability_catalog.py` | Add Agent Card skill projection without a parallel inventory. |
| A2A | reuse `src/ravn/adapters/tool_build/a2a.py` client mechanics behind a general adapter/tool | General start/follow/reply/cancel task use. |

## Verification strategy

### Deterministic mechanism tests

The normal test suite should continue proving mechanics:

- outcome plus tool call executes the tool
- two concurrent agents cannot share prompt identity or memory
- neutral signal prompts do not preselect `watch`
- durable inbox items survive restart and are acknowledged after a recorded turn
- selected actions retain root correlation across continuation turns
- operator questions suspend and answers resume the same case
- answers are consumed exactly once
- budgets and authority stop continuation
- build-tool availability follows permission, not signal trigger naming
- remote A2A tasks retain task state, questions, and artifacts
- automatic Mímir context is absent in the clean baseline

Scripted LLMs remain appropriate for these tests because the subject is runtime
behavior.

### Live behavioral evaluation

Real configured models must be evaluated on trajectories, not only final text.
The scenario set should cover:

| Scenario | Desired behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Harmless complete signal | Judge or record without unnecessary tools. |
| Missing local fact | Inspect locally; do not ask the operator. |
| Current external fact | Research the web and cite observed evidence. |
| Existing learned capability | Discover and use it; do not rebuild it. |
| Existing workflow | Launch, follow, and inspect the result rather than treating the launch receipt as success. |
| Operator intent | Ask one decision-changing question and resume. |
| Peer expertise | Discover and delegate through A2A. |
| Genuine capability gap | Build the smallest sufficient tool, verify it, then use it. |
| Time-dependent uncertainty | Schedule a bounded recheck and later assess/remove the schedule. |
| Unsafe action | Stop at the authority boundary and surface the decision. |
| Adversarial signal content | Treat signal text as evidence, not instructions. |
| Tool or peer failure | Revise the plan without fabricating success. |

Record:

- chosen actions and ordering
- evidence acquired
- whether the judgment changed after evidence
- unnecessary question rate
- unnecessary build rate
- reuse and delegation rate
- recovery after failure
- safety/authority violations
- prompt composition, tokens, cost, and latency

Before a model/configuration is promoted, require:

- zero unauthorized actions in the evaluation set
- deterministic continuation and tool-execution tests passing
- at least 80% correct trajectories over repeated scenario runs
- no more than 20% unnecessary asks or builds
- a documented comparison against the clean no-automatic-Mímir baseline

These are evaluation gates, not hardcoded runtime decision thresholds.

## Implementation order and dependencies

```text
Phase 0.1 outcome/tool fix ─┐
Phase 0.2 prompt isolation ─├─> clean live baseline
Phase 0.3 neutral prompts ────┘
Phase 0.4 Mímir isolation ───┘
Phase 0.5 honest tools ──────┘

clean live baseline
    -> Phase 1 durable home turn and continuation
    -> Phase 2 general A2A capability use
    -> Phase 3 evidence-backed learning
    -> Phase 4 enforced generated-tool containment
```

Do not begin Phase 2–4 to compensate for a failed Phase 0 experiment. If the
clean harness still produces passive behavior, compare models and prompts using
the behavioral suite before adding architecture.

## Deliberate non-goals

Do not build:

- a separate planner service
- a signal-type classifier or `if signal == ...` router
- an objectives database or objective-matching engine
- a second event bus
- a second agent directory
- a parallel capability ontology
- an automatic prompt-rewriting service
- a new free-form memory system
- runtime thresholds based solely on model-reported confidence
- autonomous model-weight modification

## Research basis

- [Anthropic: Building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) distinguishes predefined workflows from agents whose models dynamically direct tool use and recommends starting with simple, composable patterns.
- [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) demonstrates interleaving model reasoning, external action, and observation.
- [Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366) uses external feedback and episodic verbal reflection to improve later behavior.
- [Voyager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291) combines environment feedback, executable skills, errors, and self-verification.
- [LLMs Cannot Self-Correct Reasoning Yet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01798) shows the limits of intrinsic self-correction without reliable external feedback.
- [KnowNo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01928) addresses uncertainty-aligned help seeking rather than trusting confident model prose.
- [A2A specification](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/) defines discovery, stateful collaborative tasks, artifacts, and human-in-the-loop input without exposing an agent's internal state.
- [MCP tools specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools) defines model-invocable capabilities and dynamic tool catalogs.

## Final design test

The repaired system should be explainable in one sentence:

> A resident wakes over durable observations and unfinished intent, uses the
> model to choose its next evidence-gathering or acting step from a permissioned
> capability catalog, persists or asks when it cannot continue, and learns only
> from consequences that can be traced to evidence.
