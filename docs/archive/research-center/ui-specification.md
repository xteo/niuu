# Research Center — UI Specification

Companion to [`implementation-guide.md`](implementation-guide.md). This document describes the UI itself — every screen, every component, every state, every interaction. It is the design contract: what's built today, what each piece is for, and what must be true for it to ship.

The prototype lives at `ting/Research Center.html`. Open it for the live reference; this doc captures it in writing.

## 1. Information architecture

The Research Center is a top-level **Ting tab** — peer of Dashboard, Sagas, Dispatch, Plan, Workflows. Three routes:

```
/ting/research                 → Index (campaign list)
/ting/research/new             → 5-step wizard
/ting/research/{slug}          → Detail (Reading view)
/ting/research/{slug}?drawer=… → Detail with drawer pre-opened (deep link)
```

The detail page is **one focused layout** — the Reading view. No layout switcher in production. (Four alt layouts exist in the prototype as visual exploration; they are not part of the ship surface.)

### Mental model

A **research campaign** is a Q&A object. A question goes in; a curated answer plus durable learnings come out. Everything in the UI orients around that:

- The page title **is** the question.
- The hero is the **answer** (or working thesis if not yet synthesized).
- Evidence, critique, learnings, follow-ups, and Mímir state sit below the answer as **progressively-disclosed sections**.
- A right-side drawer opens **any file, source, critique, or operator surface in place** without scrolling away.

---

## 2. Shell chrome

The Niuu plugin rail (left, 48px) and Ting topbar (56px) are shared with every other Ting screen.

### Plugin rail (left, 48px wide)

Vertical strip with a brand mark (`ᚠ`) at the top and one rune per plugin: Observatory `ᛞ`, **Ting `ᛃ` (active)**, Bifröst `ᚨ`, Völundr `ᚲ`, Mímir `ᛗ`, Valkyrie `ᛒ`. Active plugin has a 2px left-border in `--color-brand` (ice blue in the prototype's default theme).

### Topbar (top, 56px)

Left: Ting glyph + name + sub-label "saga & run orchestration". Then the tab strip:

- Dashboard
- Sagas {count}
- **Research {count} ← active**
- Dispatch
- Plan
- Workflows

Right: dispatcher status pills — `dispatcher on`, `threshold 0.70`, `concurrent 3/5`, `cluster valhalla`. Mono font; same shape as on the existing Ting pages.

### Footer (bottom, 24px)

Route path (`/ting/research`), workflow version `workflows v1.0.0`, current research-campaign workflow id, and "connected via skuld" status.

---

## 3. Index page

`/ting/research`

### Toolbar

A row above the content:

- **Search** — left-side input, mono font, placeholder `search by title, slug, question…`, `⌘K` hint.
- **Filter chips** — `All {n}` · `Needs attention {n}` · `Running {n}` · `Published {n}` · `Drafts {n}`. "Needs attention" = `blocked + failed + review`.
- **Grid / Table toggle** — segmented control, right-aligned.
- **+ New campaign** — primary button, right-aligned.

### Metrics strip

Five cards spanning the width:

- Running — count of `state=running`, accent color, sub "active runs"
- Review-ready — count of `state=review`, brand color
- Blocked / failed — count of `state ∈ {blocked,failed}`, critical color
- Published — count of `state=published`, dim
- Drafts — count of `state=draft`, dim

Each card: 10px label (uppercase tracked), 22px mono value, 10px mono sub.

### Campaign grid (default)

Auto-fill, min 360px cards. Each card:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ● running   evaluative          62% · med        │  ← state pip + mode chip + confidence
│                                                  │
│ Local model serving on the homelab               │  ← title (h4, 16px, semibold)
│                                                  │
│ Can a self-hosted vLLM + sglang stack absorb…    │  ← question (13px, secondary)
│                                                  │
│ ▰▰▰▱▱▱▱   (7-tick stage progress mini)           │
│                                                  │
│ 47m · 8 src · 5 crit · 0 learn                   │  ← meta row (mono 11px)
│ ─────────────────────────────────────────────    │
│ local-model-serving        run/c1-glitnir        │  ← footer (slug + run id)
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The 7-tick stage progress turns segments green for `done`, animated brand for `active`, yellow for `blocked`, red for `failed`. Each tick has a tooltip with stage name + status.

### Campaign table (toggle)

Columns: State · Campaign · Mode · Stages · Confidence · Updated · Owner · Run.

Compact, dense — for power-users. Row click opens detail.

### Empty state (first run)

```
       ᚦ
   No campaigns yet
A research campaign starts with a question. Ting frames it,
dispatches a run of ravens, and writes the durable
learnings back to Mímir.
      [ Start your first campaign ]
```

Big glyph (the research rune), title, body, primary CTA.

### Filtered-empty state

When a filter matches zero items: smaller `◦` glyph, message, "+ New campaign" CTA.

### Requirements

- List **must** be filterable by state (chip set or query param).
- Sort options: Updated (default), Created, Confidence.
- Each card click navigates to `/ting/research/{slug}`.
- Status pip animates (pulse) only when `state=running`.
- All counts pull from the same source (`GET /ting/research/campaigns` with `state` filter applied client-side or via separate aggregate endpoint).

---

## 4. New-campaign wizard

`/ting/research/new`. Mirrors the existing `PlanWizard.tsx` pattern but tailored to research.

Five steps, `StepDots` progress indicator at top:

### Step 1 — Question

Text area, autofocus, ~120px tall. Below: 3 hint chips that pre-fill an example:

- `+ evaluative · Should we replace Skuld's WebSocket fan-out with…`
- `+ investigative · Why has Bifröst p95 climbed 40% week-over-week…`
- `+ exploratory · What design patterns work best for long-lived…`
- `+ monitoring · Watch Anthropic ToS + rate-limit changes…`

Slug preview at the bottom: `slug: research/campaigns/local-model-serving/`.

### Step 2 — Mode

2×2 grid of mode cards. Each card has:
- monospace eyebrow (`exploratory` / `evaluative` / `investigative` / `monitoring`)
- title in semibold
- one-line description
- selected state: brand-tinted border + background

Below the grid: a row showing the **default deliverable** for the chosen mode, with "(editable next step)" muted.

### Step 3 — Scope

Three plain fields:

- Audience — short text
- Expected deliverable — textarea, pre-filled with mode default
- Success criteria — textarea, pre-filled with sensible default

### Step 4 — Constraints

- Constraints — textarea
- Tools the run may use — toggleable chips (`web`, `mimir`, `file`, `terminal`)
- Budgets — three read-only chips (`tokens: 80k`, `web.fetch: 24`, `elapsed: 4h`)

### Step 5 — Confirm

Read-only review: Question · Mode · Audience · Slug · Deliverable · Success · Constraints. Plus a "Will dispatch" row showing: `7 stages · 8 personas · writes to mímir://research/campaigns/{slug}/`.

### Footer (every step)

Left: `Back` / `Cancel`. Right: `step N of 5` · `Continue →` (primary) or on the last step `Dispatch run →`.

### Requirements

- Continue disabled on step 1 unless question is at least 8 characters.
- Slug derived live from question (lowercase, alnum + hyphens, max 64 chars).
- Mode change updates default deliverable in step 3.
- On dispatch: POST `/ting/research/campaigns` with the full payload, redirect to `/ting/research/{slug}`.

---

## 5. Campaign detail — the Reading view

`/ting/research/{slug}`. The hero of the whole product.

The page is one centered column (~1080px max width) with a sticky state strip at the top. Reading-first: when you land, you can immediately see the question and the current best answer.

### 5a. State strip (sticky, top)

A 5-column grid:

```
▰▰▰▱▱▱▱  stage 3/7 · Challenge  │ ● research-skeptic  critique pass started…  │ 62% · med  │ ⟨ run/c1-glitnir · 4 sessions ⟩  │ [Operator ▸]
```

Left → right:

1. **Stage ticks** — 7 colored ticks, hover for stage name. Inline label `stage 3/7 · Challenge`. Becomes `complete · 7/7` when published, `failed at {stage}` when failed, `blocked at {stage}` when blocked.
2. **Live ticker** — pulsing dot + persona name + latest activity line. Cycles every 3s through recent events. Hidden when not running.
3. **Confidence badge** — 36px bar + percent + label (`high` / `med` / `low`).
4. **Run chip** — Völundr-rune badge, `run/c1-glitnir · 4 sessions`. Opens Völundr in a new tab.
5. **Operator button** — opens the side drawer to the Operator tab.

Sticks to the top of the viewport when scrolling. Glass background.

### 5b. Question hero

Below the strip:

```
Research › local-model-serving · ● running · evaluative      [☰ Files · 10]

Local model serving on the homelab

Can a self-hosted vLLM + sglang stack absorb the memory and strength raven
personas with low enough p95 to drop the routine Anthropic dependency?

audience · Niuu ops + bifrost owners  ·  deliverable · Decision memo + 6-week phased plan  ·  updated 17:40:52  ·  @lars
```

- Crumbs row: link back to Research index, slug in mono, state pip, mode chip. Right side: a "Files · {n}" chip that opens the side drawer to Files. The state pip and mode chip are clickable for filtered navigation back to the index.
- **Title** — `<h1>`, 28px, weight 600, letter-spacing `-0.02em`. The question's headline.
- **Question body** — 14px secondary, max 64ch.
- **Meta line** — mono 11px muted: audience · deliverable · updated · owner.

### 5c. Hero answer card

The single most important block on the page. Layout: 2-column grid (`1fr 250px`), left-aligned right column.

Eyebrow varies by state:
- `WORKING THESIS · STAGE N/7` (running)
- `REVIEW-READY · AWAITING PUBLISH TO MÍMIR` (review)
- `FINAL SYNTHESIS · PUBLISHED` (published)
- `BLOCKED AT {stage}` (blocked)
- `FAILED AT {stage}` (failed)
- `DRAFT · NOT YET DISPATCHED` (draft)

The card border + tint flexes per state (brand for running/review, brand-200 for published, yellow for blocked, red for failed, default for draft).

#### Left column — the answer prose

**Running:**
- "Tentative answer in one line. {paragraph}"
- A yellow callout box "What's being challenged right now" listing the top 3 high-severity critiques as `[cN] {claim}` bullets.
- An italic muted footer note: "The synthesist will write the final answer after the challenge stage completes. The working thesis above is the explorer's best read so far."

**Review / Published:**
- The full `final.md` rendered as prose via the `ProseAnnotated` component.
- Citations are inline `[s1]`, `[s2]`, `[c1]` chips.
- A "Clean / Annotated" toggle sits **above** the card (top-right of the section) when the answer exists.

**Blocked:**
- A warning callout: "Why we paused. {blockedReason}. The {persona} cannot proceed until this is resolved."
- "What we have so far" heading + a paragraph describing the partial state.

**Failed:**
- A critical callout: "Failure. {failedReason}."
- "What we have so far" + a paragraph.

**Draft:**
- Muted "This campaign hasn't been dispatched yet. Frame the question, pick a mode, and Ting will run the 7-stage research workflow."

#### Right column — meta-grid

Vertical stack, **left-aligned**, separated by a left border-rule. Each row is a label (9px mono uppercase muted) above a value.

Running:
- Current stage → `Challenge` (16px brand-200)
- Persona → `research-skeptic` (mono 13px)
- Confidence so far → ConfidenceBadge
- `[ Open notebook ]` ghost button

Review:
- Confidence → ConfidenceBadge (big)
- Synthesis size → `6.8k`
- Sources cited → `8`
- Critiques addressed → `5`
- `[ Publish to Mímir → ]` primary
- `[ Send back for revision ]` ghost

Published:
- Final confidence → ConfidenceBadge (big)
- Published → `2026-04-22T17:09:09Z`
- Elapsed → `4d 9h`
- Sources → `9`
- Critiques addressed → `2`
- `[ ᛗ open in Mímir ]` ext-link

Blocked:
- Status → `blocked` (big yellow)
- At stage → stage name
- Elapsed since block → `42m`
- `[ Resume after fix ]` primary
- `[ View blocking error ]` ghost
- `[ Skip stage ]` ghost

Failed:
- Status → `failed` (big red)
- At stage → stage name
- Persona → persona id
- `[ Retry from stage ]` primary
- `[ Restart campaign ]` 
- `[ View run logs ]` ghost

Draft:
- `[ Complete brief → dispatch ]` primary
- `[ Discard draft ]` ghost

### 5d. Section: Evidence (collapsible)

Heading: `▸ Evidence · {n} sources cited`  →  right-aligned: `[ Open all in side panel → ]` chip.

When expanded, a `sources-table`:

| | Title | Domain | Quality | Cited | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[s1]` | Efficient Memory Management for Large Language… | arxiv.org | ●●●●● | ×4 | ⟨ ᛗ open ⟩ |
| `[s2]` | SGLang: Efficient Execution of Structured… | arxiv.org | ●●●●● | ×3 | ⟨ ᛗ open ⟩ |
| `[s5]` | Glitnir cluster — capacity + power inventory | mimir://ops/glitnir | ●●●●● | ×5 | ⟨ ᛗ open ⟩ |

Rows are clickable — open the drawer at Sources tab with that source selected. Default sort: `× cited` descending.

Default open when `state=published`.

### 5e. Section: Skeptic's pass (collapsible)

Heading: `▸ Skeptic's pass · {n} challenges`  →  right-aligned: `[ Open all in side panel → ]` chip + count rollup (`2 high · 2 med`).

When expanded, a vertical list of critique cards. Each card:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [c1]  Throughput numbers are aspirational                  high │  ← claim + severity
│                                                                 │
│ against: 30 t/s on Spark                                        │
│                                                                 │
│ Single-stream Llama.cpp figure; not vLLM batched. Need          │
│ benchmark before any "drop Anthropic" claim.                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Critical-color left border. Severity chip on the right. Clicking the card opens the drawer at Critiques tab with that critique selected.

Default open when `state ∈ {running, review}`.

### 5f. Section: Learnings & follow-ups (collapsible)

Two sub-lists side-by-side or stacked:

**Durable learnings** — `lf-card`s with title (semibold) + body (secondary 12px) + `[ ᛗ open ]` button (opens manifest in drawer).

**Open follow-ups** — `lf-card`s with title + meta line (`owner · @lars`, `est · 2 weeks`) + `[ ᛗ open ]` button.

Only renders when `state ∈ {published, review}` or when `state=blocked` and the block happened after stage 4 (curation).

### 5g. Section: Durable memory (collapsible)

Heading: `▸ Durable memory · what's in Mímir vs notebook`  →  rollup chip: `N published · N review-ready · N notebook`.

When expanded:

- **Published list** — brand-tinted cards, one per published Mímir page. Each shows title, mímir path (mono), file size, `[ ᛗ open ]` (opens in drawer at Files).
- **Review-ready list** — dashed-border rows with path + Mímir pip.
- **Local notebook only (details collapsed)** — `<details>` element. Expand to see notebook-only files.
- **Side artifacts** — `learnings/research/{slug}.md` + `followups/research/{slug}.md` ext-links.

Every row is clickable; all clicks route to the drawer.

---

## 6. Side drawer

A single right-aligned panel, 560px wide, `position: absolute; right: 0`. **Overlays** the page — never pushes content. Stays open until the user closes it.

### Header

```
ᚲ  Local model serving on the homelab                            ×
   local-model-serving
```

Völundr rune + campaign title + slug. Close `×` on the far right.

### Tab strip

```
Files 10  │  Sources 8  │  Critiques 5  │  Operator
```

Four tabs. Underline active. Counts in mono.

### Tab — Files

The default. Shows artifact bodies.

- **Chip strip** along the top: every artifact in the campaign as a chip (`brief.md`, `plan.md`, `breadth.md`, `depth.md`, `contrarian.md`, `exploration.md`, `analysis.md`, `sources.md`, `critique.md`, `final.md`, `manifest.md`). Horizontally scrollable. Each chip shows `{path}` + a Mímir pip (`ᛗ` for published, `·` otherwise).
- **File header**: title (semibold 14px) + path (mono 11px muted) + Mímir pip + file size.
- **Body**: rendered prose via `ProseAnnotated`. For `sources.md` the body is a `SourcesTable`. For `critique.md` it's a `CritiqueList`. For unwritten files (`bytes === 0`), an empty state explaining which persona writes it.

Order of chips follows persona-write order: brief, plan, notes/*, analysis, sources, critique, final, manifest.

### Tab — Sources

Master-detail.

- **Top half** (max 220px tall, scrollable): list of all sources. Each row: `[sN]` tag + title + quality dots + cited count. Active row highlights.
- **Bottom half** (fills the rest, scrollable):
  - Eyebrow `Source · [sN]`
  - Title (16px semibold)
  - Domain (mono muted)
  - 3-column meta block (quality, cited, kind)
  - "Excerpt (would be pulled from Mímir)" — placeholder quote box
  - **Cited in** list — deep-link buttons to the artifacts that cite this source (e.g. `final.md`, `notes/exploration.md`). Clicking jumps the drawer to Files tab at that artifact.
  - Footer: `[ ᛗ open in Mímir ]` + `[ ↗ open external ]`.

### Tab — Critiques

Same master-detail as Sources.

- Top: list of all critiques (`[cN]` + claim + severity).
- Bottom: eyebrow, claim, against, skeptic's note, severity chip, linked artifacts (`critique.md`, `final.md`).

### Tab — Operator

Live operations surface.

- Three sub-chips: `Activity` / `Run` / `Actions`.
- **Activity**: live event stream (ActivityLog component), virtualized list of timestamps + personas + messages.
- **Run**: run id, cluster, sessions, elapsed, plus a list of every persona on this run with its current status.
- **Actions**: state-dependent buttons (Pause / Skip / Increase budget / Retry from stage / Restart / Publish / Send back / Open in Völundr / Open manifest / Archive).

### URL state

Drawer state lives in the URL so deep-linking works:

```
?drawer=files&file=brief.md
?drawer=sources&n=s1
?drawer=critiques&n=c2
?drawer=operator&sub=activity
```

Close drawer → query params removed.

### Keyboard

- `Esc` closes the drawer.
- `←/→` (optional v2) step through items within the active tab.

### Requirements

- The drawer must **overlay** — clicking outside does NOT close it (it's not a modal; reading-page underneath stays visible).
- Every "open" link on the detail page routes to the drawer at the right tab + selected item.
- Tab counts come from the campaign detail response, no separate fetches.
- Switching tabs preserves the campaign — the header doesn't change.

---

## 7. Inline citations + provenance

The Final synthesis must be readable without losing trust. The UX rule: **you cannot read a claim without being able to see what it stands on.**

### Clean mode (default)

Citations are inline chips: `[s1]`, `[c1]`. Brand-300 for sources, critical-red for critiques.

Click → small popover anchored to the chip:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SOURCE · [s1]                         │
│  Efficient Memory Management for…      │
│  arxiv.org · cited ×4 · q5/5           │
│                                        │
│  ▌ Excerpt from this source            │
│  ▌ supporting the claim…               │
│                                        │
│  [ ᛗ open ]  [ close ]                │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For critique citations, the popover is critical-colored and shows the claim + "against" + skeptic's note.

The popover's "open" button promotes to the side drawer at the right tab.

### Annotated mode

A toggle above the answer card flips reading mode. In annotated mode:

- The prose stays in a left column (max 72ch).
- A right gutter (260px) holds note cards aligned to the paragraph that cites them.
- Each note card: tag chip ([sN] / [cN]), title, body, "open" button.
- Source notes: brand-300 left border. Critique notes: critical left border.

This is the **claim-attached provenance** mode — you can read with every supporting source visible in your peripheral vision.

### Requirements

- Citation tokens are stable per campaign — never renumbered.
- Source / critique resolution is intra-campaign only in v1.
- The Clean ↔ Annotated toggle is only present on `state ∈ {review, published}` — there's no synthesized answer to annotate before then.

---

## 8. State variants

Each campaign state changes the hero card, the available actions, the section default-open state, and the meta-grid. The table:

| State | Hero eyebrow | Hero body | Meta column action | Section defaults |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `draft` | DRAFT · NOT YET DISPATCHED | "This campaign hasn't been dispatched…" | `[ Complete brief → dispatch ]` | all collapsed |
| `running` | WORKING THESIS · STAGE N/7 | Tentative answer + "What's being challenged right now" | `[ Open notebook ]` | Skeptic's pass open |
| `blocked` | BLOCKED AT {stage} | Why we paused callout + "What we have so far" | `[ Resume after fix ]` + `[ Skip stage ]` | Skeptic's pass open |
| `failed` | FAILED AT {stage} | Failure callout + "What we have so far" | `[ Retry from stage ]` + `[ Restart ]` | all collapsed |
| `review` | REVIEW-READY · AWAITING PUBLISH | Full final synthesis (prose with citations) | `[ Publish to Mímir → ]` + `[ Send back ]` | Skeptic's pass open |
| `published` | FINAL SYNTHESIS · PUBLISHED | Full final synthesis | `[ ᛗ open in Mímir ]` | Evidence open |

The state strip's stage-tick row + active label, the ticker line, and the meta-row pill colors all flex on the same axis.

### Empty / loading / error

- **Loading**: skeleton state — show the strip + question with skeletons, hide the hero card until data arrives.
- **404**: show the index empty state with `glyph=◦` and a "Campaign not found" message.
- **Network error**: muted banner above the question: "Couldn't reach Ting. Retrying…"; retain whatever was last cached.

## 10. Visual language

Pulled from the Niuu design system. Stay strict.

### Palette

- Canvas: `--color-bg-primary` (zinc-950)
- Panels / cards: `--color-bg-secondary` (zinc-900)
- Hover / wells: `--color-bg-tertiary` (zinc-800)
- Tooltips / chips: `--color-bg-elevated` (zinc-700)
- Text: 4-step from `#fafafa` → `#a1a1aa` → `#71717a` → `#52525b`
- Borders: `--color-border` / `--color-border-subtle`

### Brand (ice theme — research default)

Brand ramp `--brand-100` (#f0f9ff) → `--brand-500` (#38bdf8) → `--brand-900` (#0c4a6e). The whole UI reads as a cold operator console.

### Status

- `running` / `dispatched` → animated brand-300 dot
- `review` → solid brand-300
- `published` / `complete` → brand-200
- `blocked` → `#fbbf24` (amber yellow)
- `failed` → `--color-critical` (#ef4444)
- `draft` / `archived` / `idle` → muted text

### Mode chip colors

- `exploratory` → brand-300 (ice blue)
- `evaluative` → `#a855f7` (purple)
- `investigative` → `#f97316` (orange)
- `monitoring` → `#10b981` (emerald)

### Type

- Sans: Inter — body, labels, titles.
- Mono: JetBrainsMono NF — identifiers, ids, paths, runes, numeric.
- 28px h1 with `-0.02em` letter-spacing — used once per page (question title).
- 10px uppercase tracked (`0.07em`) — universal label / eyebrow.
- 14px body default. 13px for secondary prose.

### Density + spacing

- `--space-3` (12px) row gap.
- `--space-4` (16px) card padding.
- `--space-5` (20px) card padding for hero.
- `--space-6` (24px) page padding.

### Motion

- 150ms color transitions.
- 200ms default.
- One slow pulse (2.4s) for the running stage tick + live dot.
- No bounce, no spring, no shadow lifts. Depth comes from border + bg contrast.

### Borders, radii, shadows

- Cards: 1px solid subtle border, `--radius-md` (8px).
- Hero: `--radius-lg` (12px).
- Drawer: no border-radius on the inside edge; lives flush right.
- Shadows reserved for the drawer's left edge (`-8px 0 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.35)`); nowhere else.

## 11. Interaction patterns

### Clicking artifact paths

Any path-styled element (mono, brand color) opens the side drawer at Files with that path selected. Examples:
- Sources table "open" buttons
- Critique card "open" buttons
- Memory section file rows
- Hero meta column "Open notebook"
- Cite-popover "open" buttons

### Drawer navigation

- Tabs are stateful; opening at Sources stays on Sources until you explicitly switch.
- Source/critique selection is preserved when switching tabs.
- Closing the drawer remembers the last tab; reopening goes back there.

### Stage rail clicks

In the state strip, clicking a stage tick scrolls the page to the section that maps to it (e.g. challenge → Skeptic's pass) and opens it. (Optional v2.)

### Section collapsibles

`▸` rotates to `▾` on open. Open state can be persisted per campaign per session (localStorage keyed by slug). Default-open depends on state (see §8).

### Confidence display

The ConfidenceBadge is the same control everywhere — 36px bar + percentage + label.

### Citation chip click

- Clean mode: opens the popover. Click again on same chip → closes.
- Annotated mode: scrolls the gutter to the matching note card (and pulses it briefly).
- Both modes: the popover's "open" button jumps to the side drawer.

### Operator drawer

Top-right `Operator ▸` in the state strip. Opens drawer at Operator tab. The button is always visible (even when state=published) so you can still review run logs.

### Wizard

Standard wizard pattern — Back/Cancel left, Continue/Dispatch right. Step dots in between. Field validation gates Continue.

### Loading states

Every section that fetches data has a skeleton: same dimensions as the real content, animated shimmer (very subtle).

## 12. Responsive / density

**Desktop-first.** v1 ships at 1280px+ with graceful degradation to 1024px.

- 1280px: full layout (1080px content + 200px side margins).
- 1024px–1280px: content shrinks to ~960px, drawer takes 520px, side margins minimum.
- < 1024px: not a v1 target. Acceptable to show a simple "open on desktop for the full operator surface" message.

A **density toggle** (comfortable / compact) is mentioned as a possible Tweaks option but not in v1 scope. Comfortable is the default.

---

## 13. Accessibility

### Keyboard

- `Tab` traverses every interactive element.
- `Enter` activates buttons / links.
- `Esc` closes the drawer.
- `←/→` step through drawer items within active tab (v2).
- All citation chips are focusable; `Enter` opens the popover.

### Screen reader

- Stage ticks: each has `title` and `aria-label` (`stage 3 of 7 · Challenge · active`).
- Status pip: `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"` for ticker.
- Section collapsibles: `aria-expanded` on the trigger.
- Drawer: `role="dialog"` `aria-label="Campaign artifacts"`; not modal (doesn't trap focus, but `Esc` closes).
- Mode chips: `role="status"`.

### Color contrast

- All text passes WCAG AA on the zinc-950 canvas.
- Status colors are paired with shape / label (never color-only).
- Brand ice-blue (`--brand-500: #38bdf8`) on `--color-bg-secondary` passes AA.

### Motion

- The pulse animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — falls back to a solid color, no pulsing.

## 14. Out-of-scope alt layouts

The prototype contains four alternate detail-page layouts kept for visual reference but **not** part of the production build:

- **Mission Control** — 3-column with artifact list + viewer + live panel. Operator-dense.
- **Chronicle** — top-tabs + vertical timeline + ambient ticker. Storytelling-focused.
- **Studio** — kanban of artifacts (7 columns, one per stage). Movement-focused.
- **Atlas** — spatial canvas, stages on a serpentine arc, artifacts orbiting. Map-style.

These shipped in the prototype's Tweaks panel as a "detail concept" switcher to give the designer feedback options. **Production ships only Reading.** Delete the alt-layout files when porting.

## Appendix — prototype-only features to drop

- The **Tweaks panel** (theme, concept switcher, demo state) is a prototype host-feature. Not shipped.
- The four **alt layouts** (Mission Control, Chronicle, Studio, Atlas). Reference only.
- Hardcoded mock data in `research-data.jsx`. Replaced by real API.
- The demo-state Tweaks dropdown. Real state comes from the backend.
