# Skuld agent and planning research plan

## Objective and scope

Expose existing harness capabilities through one discoverable Skuld API for human
frontends and authorized agent clients. Define a common language without pretending
all harnesses have identical control, planning, persistence or collaboration semantics.
This is research and a proposed contract, not a shipped API or deployment assignment.

The gateway is **Skuld**. The confirmed requested harnesses are Claude/tmux, Codex,
Grok (registered as **xAI Grok Build**), Pi and Meta Muse Code. There is no separate
Build harness in scope. Include OpenCode as an explicitly supplementary comparison
because it is also registered; its Build/Plan roles are not separate harnesses.

## Task register

| ID | Work | Owner | State | Depends on | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Confirm harness identities and adapter boundaries | Parent | completed | — | Source registry and direct name confirmation |
| R2 | Claude/tmux subagents, teams, plans/tasks | Existing native child `app_server_protocol` | completed | — | Official docs plus tmux source mapping; key claims independently checked |
| R3 | Grok and Muse capabilities/protocols | Existing native child `niuu_projection` | completed | — | Pinned vendor sources plus adapter mapping; key claims independently checked |
| R4 | Pi, OpenCode and effective Codex baseline | Parent | completed | — | Primary sources and version-qualified evidence |
| R5 | Agent and planning comparison matrices | Parent | completed | R1–R4 | Native/projected/unknown distinctions in comparison report |
| R6 | Common vocabulary, proposed API and acceptance matrix | Parent | completed | R5 | First design draft, not approved implementation |
| R7 | Codex long sessions, supervisor/tmux patterns, Ultra | Parent with two bounded child follow-ups | completed | R6 | Public selector/message/reload sources, official long-session examples and practitioner source inspected |
| R8 | Validate citations/contracts, commit/push and hand off | Parent | running | R6–R7 | Documents, validation output, coordinator receipt |

This Markdown task register is a durable research checklist, not a background
scheduler. The parent actively executes and updates it. Runtime completion is
distinct from inspecting and accepting a child's findings.

## Execution boundaries

- Reuse the two already-created native children; maximum two concurrent research
  children and no fanout, extra Forge sessions, provider experiments or installs.
- Each child gets one bounded read-only track, about twelve minutes and 8–12 focused
  source retrievals before returning evidence or explicit uncertainty.
- Parent owns this worktree's documentation, synthesis and verification. Children
  do not write files. No concurrent product edits or merges with other owners.
- Read local contracts first. Prefer current official docs and first-party sources.
  Installed binary/schema evidence is qualified separately from documentation and
  from actual effective launcher/runtime observations.
- No other live conversations, service changes, auth/config mutations, device work
  or external worktree changes. No private reasoning/transcripts in deliverables.
- Phase two follows the comparison/API draft; it does not postpone the first-phase
  findings or grant permission to build a new scheduler.
- Send meaningful milestones through the existing OpenClaw route. Keep the shared
  hourly reporter; create no new schedule. Share documents as full host-path links.
