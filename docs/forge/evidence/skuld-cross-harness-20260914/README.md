# Cross-harness research evidence

## Scope and provenance

September 14, 2026. Documentation/research only, source base
`21bb0de6ec0ec467865382dd99640cf37b6cffdb`, isolated branch
`xteo/codex-subagents-workflow-20260914`.

Runner `thor:0a713405-79b2-566c-a953-802e3a080c49`; supervisor
`thor:8f20102d-6da7-58aa-98c2-e0bce2deab97`.
No software installed, settings/auth changed, service restarted, production code
edited, foreign sessions inspected, or live provider acceptance tests run.

## Native child tracks

Only the two earlier native children were reused with follow-up tasks; no new
Forge sessions or child fanout. Both initial comparison follow-ups completed and
returned explicit source/version limits. Parent inspected the key claimed code
paths and fetched primary documentation and pinned public source independently.

| Child | Native thread | Comparison objective | Result inspected |
|---|---|---|---|
| `app_server_protocol` / Laplace | `01a09fd1-c5c9-7973-8202-06e43bc1857f` | Claude/tmux agents, teams and tasks | Current tools/model availability, hooks identity mismatch, team and queue semantics |
| `niuu_projection` / Gibbs | `01a09fd1-f13b-73d3-87d8-366f5b4eedf5` | Grok/Muse native protocol vs adapters | Pinned child controls, Muse queue durability claim, projection and resume gaps |

The parent native thread is `01a09fd1-38e6-7b13-84c0-bbf0df249a47`.
Earlier read-only native identity evidence is preserved in
[native read results](../codex-native-agent-ui-20260914/native-read-results.json).
Repeated SubagentStart/tool calls are attempts on reusable agents, not automatically
new agent identities. Both second-phase follow-ups completed and their results were
inspected: Laplace supplied official long-session examples and pinned NTM controller
evidence; Gibbs supplied public Codex policy/message/reload and cross-task sources.
Parent independently checked the selector, message dispatch, reload, NTM controller
and restore code, and retrieved the official cross-task PR descriptions. No native
children remain doing this research; completion callbacks are recorded in Forge's
session history. No additional child agents were launched.

## Tests actually executed

Initial system-Python collection failed on missing `asyncpg`; no tests executed in
that attempt. No dependency installation attempted. Then used the existing project
interpreter with imports selecting this worktree and bytecode writes disabled:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src" \
 /home/thor/repos/niuu/.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -o addopts='' \
 -m 'not integration and not tmux' \
 tests/test_skuld/test_pi_transport.py \
 tests/test_skuld/test_grok_transport.py \
 tests/test_skuld/test_muse_transport.py
```

Result: **91 passed in 2.06 seconds**, no warnings reported.
[Captured output](adapter-tests.log). Tests use mocked native processes/streams;
no live Grok/Muse/Pi execution, tmux or database acceptance was performed.
These passing tests do not prove the proposed API or every desirable invariant;
the Muse suite even contains a test expecting fresh-start fallback after failed
resume, which the report explicitly rejects as a continuity guarantee.

## Source capture

[Source manifest](source-manifest.json) records URL, retrieval time, size and SHA256
for selected primary-source snapshots. Full retrieved pages are private research
cache, not redistributed documentation. The report links to vendor originals.
Pinned Grok and Muse public commits are recorded in the report; mutable official
docs and Pi main-branch examples are dated observations, not release pins.

Important independent check: Claude teams documentation says the lead session
approves an arriving teammate plan without lead review; this was verified in the
official Markdown source, section “Have teammates plan before implementing.”
It is not a verified property of an existing live Claude session.

Effective runtime verification is strongest for this runner's Codex 0.154.0.
Claude PATH version is child-reported and not a live-launcher qualification.
Other current installed effective runtimes are explicitly unverified.

The effective schema's ignored `multiAgentMode` field was an important correction
to the earlier audit. [Extracted mode contract](codex-mode-contract.json) preserves
the field-level deprecation alongside the retained enum. The matching public source
was checked at `rust-v0.154.0`; tag match is not binary identity or proof of effective
private model-catalog overrides.

[Machine-readable comparison](capability-matrix.json) is a research classification,
not a claimed current Skuld endpoint response. [Document checks](document-checks.json)
record JSON/link/schema consistency, not native runtime acceptance.

Document validation checked five Markdown artifacts, 26 local links, six capability
rows, 20 downloaded-source hashes and the field-level mode deprecation, with no
errors. A final cross-artifact edit also corrects the superseded first audit's
policy table. Final Git checks and secret scan apply only to this runner's branch.

## Remaining qualification

Real owned acceptance sessions would be required later for control/cancel timing,
native queue crash recovery, enabled plugins/features, budget enforcement, replay
and cross-client UI parity. No such tests are implicitly authorized by this report.
Document/schema checks are tracked separately from native/provider acceptance.
