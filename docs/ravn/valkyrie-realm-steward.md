# Valkyrie Realm Steward — Architecture & Implementation Plan

> Status: design proposal (v0.1)
> Author: drafted with Claude, 2026-06-19
> Scope: turn the Valkyrie from a task-runner into a **resident operator-founder for a
> domain** — what we call a **Realm Steward** — built by composing primitives that
> already exist in Volundr, plus a small number of new ones.

---

## 1. The reframe

We are not building "an agent that completes tasks." We are building a **resident
steward of a Realm** that, given a tiny human seed, grows its own understanding of the
domain and continuously asks:

```
Given what I care about,
given what I know,
given what I cannot yet do,
given what changed recently,
what would make this Realm better?
```

Two non-negotiable product constraints from the operator:

1. **The charter is a seed, not a cage.** The only human-authored artifact is a few
   sentences. Everything else (beliefs, questions, opportunities, capabilities,
   projects, experiments) is machine-authored and machine-maintained. The human answers
   the occasional high-leverage question and approves gated actions. No giant YAML
   soul-file to babysit.

2. **Tools include embodied capabilities.** A 3D printer is not `print(file.stl)`. It is
   a *managed relationship*: known state, known failure modes, autonomy limits, and a
   feedback loop the steward learns from. The steward must be able to design → slice →
   (gate) → print → inspect → improve → reprint.

**Naming.** A **Realm** is the specific stewarded thing (`Kanuck Valley Models`, `Home`).
A **Valkyrie** is the resident steward agent that keeps a Realm. (`domain` is *already
taken* as a coarse Sleipnir enum — `code|infrastructure|home|business|personal` — so we
deliberately use *Realm* for the specific instance. A Realm declares which Sleipnir
`domain` it belongs to.)

**The crux.** What makes this an *organism* and not a *tool* is a single missing primitive:
an intrinsic **drive** (§4.4). It is the one thing Volundr does not have today — verified, not
assumed — and the one the operator named first: *"not a better scheduler — a domain drive."*
Everything else in this doc is the **body** that drive acts through. The system today is
poked, scheduled, turn-based; the drive is what makes it self-directed and keeps the human
out of the loop.

---

## 2. Key finding: the **body** exists, the **drive** does not

The exploration (ravn, ting, volundr/skuld, mimir/sleipnir/bifrost, plus a buri/regions and
a continuous-drive verification pass) shows the *body* maps onto existing code with high
fidelity — **reuse, don't rebuild** the parts below. But the *will* — the continuous,
intrinsic drive — is genuinely absent. The table maps the **body**; §4.4 builds the
**drive**.

| Vision concept | Existing primitive | Where | Reuse posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Execution substrate** (runs an action once decided) | `DriveLoop` daemon — but today it is **trigger-poked**: triggers enqueue tasks, the executor drains them; idle-waits otherwise. It is *not* an intrinsic drive (verified). | `src/ravn/drive_loop.py` | **Reuse the daemon+executor as the body's runner — do NOT mistake it for the drive** |
| **World Model / beliefs / journal** | Mimir wiki: typed pages, `Compiled Truth` (rewritable, typed edges `[[slug]] — rel: x —`) + `Timeline` (append-only evidence), confidence frontmatter, `FactEvidence` proof-count + freshness trend, `POST /mimir/page/revise` (records belief change forever) | `src/mimir/`, `src/mimir/FORMAT.md`, `src/mimir/learning.py` | **Reuse — this is the substrate** |
| **World-model → agent injection** | Retrieval **reflex**: zero-LLM entity-pointer injection into live turns | `src/ravn/reflex.py`, `src/skuld/config.py` (`ReflexConfig`) | **Reuse** |
| **Capability hunger / learned tools** | `valkyrie_evolution/` — wakefulness (WAKEFUL/WATCHING/DREAMING/SLEEPING), `resident_learning.py` (capability-gap → micro-dream → author a learned tool), `OperationalSignal` | `src/ravn/valkyrie_evolution/` (currently **dormant**) | **Wire it up** |
| **Pattern → skill / belief updates** | `PatternExtractor` over episodic memory | `src/ravn/context/evolution.py` (**dormant**) | **Wire it up** |
| **Emergent execution loop** (reason→act→observe→adapt) | Ravn **agent turn loop** — `RavnAgent.run_turn` (ReAct-style: each step emerges from the last), wrapped by `DriveLoop` for autonomy | `src/ravn/agent.py`, `src/ravn/drive_loop.py` | **Reuse — this IS the steward** |
| **Inline approval / trust gate** | Ravn `PermissionEnforcer` (`allow` / `deny` / **`ask`**) + `ApprovalMemory` + `ask_user`, checked at tool-call time per action | `src/ravn/adapters/permission/`, `src/ravn/config.py` | **Reuse — gate the action, not a graph** |
| **Optional pipeline backend** (repeatable code campaigns) | Ting **workflows** (`gate`/`end` nodes), launched via REST only when the steward delegates a discrete, pre-shaped job | `src/ting/api/workflows.py` | **Reuse — only where work is genuinely a pipeline** |
| **Cost / budget gate** | Bifrost `BudgetGuardrailConfig` (warn 80% → route cheaper, reject 100%, degradation chain), `QuotaConfig`, `UsageStore` | `src/bifrost/config.py` | **Reuse as the `spend` gate** |
| **Attention tiers** | `OutputMode` = `SILENT/AMBIENT/PRESENT/URGENT/SURFACE`; Sleipnir `urgency` float + `domain` enum | `src/ravn/domain/models.py`, `src/sleipnir/domain/events.py` | **Reuse** |
| **Event-driven wake-ups (domain-aware)** | Sleipnir `SleipnirEvent` (type `namespace.domain.action`, urgency, domain, correlation/causation); namespaces already include `valkyrie`, `signal`, `attention`, `environment`, `learning` | `src/sleipnir/domain/events.py`, `catalog.py` | **Reuse + add event types** |
| **Delegation / sub-agents / mesh** | `RavnIdentity`/`RavnPeer`, `MeshPort` (publish/subscribe/send-RPC), discovery (mdns/sleipnir/k8s), cascade tools (`task_create`/`task_status`/`task_collect`) | `src/ravn/ports/mesh.py`, `discovery.py`, `adapters/tools/cascade_tools.py` | **Reuse for execution fan-out** |
| **Triggers / cron / recurring** | `TriggerPort` + cron / ting-queue / mimir-staleness / sleipnir-event / dream-cycle / wakefulness adapters | `src/ravn/ports/trigger.py`, `src/ravn/adapters/triggers/` | **Reuse + add `StewardDriveTrigger`** |
| **External tools (MCP)** | `MCPManager`/`MCPTool` (stdio/sse/http), per-session MCP config in launch spec | `src/ravn/adapters/mcp/manager.py`, `src/skuld/` | **Reuse as transport for managed tools** |

**Conclusion:** the **body** is present — memory (Mimir), the agent turn loop, tools, inline
permission gates, the budget gate (Bifrost), the attention-tier vocabulary (OutputMode +
Sleipnir), the daemon shell + executor (DriveLoop), even the dormant capability-hunger
machinery (valkyrie_evolution). But the **will is not.** There is no intrinsic drive: today
every action is externally poked (cron / event / human / mesh), and the system *executes
autonomously when told to, but never decides on its own whether to* (verified by code
exploration). The missing primitive is exactly the one the operator named first — **not a
better scheduler, a domain drive.** That is the heart of this plan (§4.4), and it is net-new.

> **The steward is an agent loop, not a workflow.** Its behavior is *emergent* — the
> operator's own primitive: `Charter → Curiosity → Belief Formation → Verification →
> Action`, explicitly **not** `Charter → Fixed Config → Agent Behavior`. A pre-authored DAG
> (a Ting workflow graph) *is* "fixed config," so the steward's cognition and its
> craft/experiment loops are **not** modeled as workflows. The substrate is the **Ravn
> agent turn loop** (`agent.py:run_turn`): reason → act (tool) → observe → update beliefs →
> decide the next step from what just happened — wrapped by the DriveLoop for autonomy.
> *Each step emerges from the previous one; the path is not planned in advance.* Ting
> workflows remain useful only as an **optional backend** for discrete, genuinely-repeatable
> code campaigns the steward chooses to delegate (and there, workflow `gate`/`end` nodes —
> not the legacy ReviewEngine — are the gate). Gating for the steward itself is **inline,
> per-action** (§4.7).

---

## 3. The genuine gaps (what is actually new)

**The biggest gap, and the heart of the whole thing: there is no intrinsic *drive* (§4.4).**
Today the system is a poked executor — it acts only when a trigger, event, or human tells it
to (verified). Building the continuous appraisal-and-motivation loop *is* the project;
everything below is in service of it.

1. **Realm + Charter as first-class primitives.** No structured "this is a stewarded
   domain with a sacred seed + a learned model." Today the closest is a persona
   `system_prompt`.
2. **Domain Discovery Loop.** No "seed → infer likely map → inspect → research →
   hypotheses → verify cheaply → ask only high-leverage questions → update model"
   bootstrap. The DriveLoop is *reactive* (cron/event/mesh), not *generative*.
3. **Opportunity Ledger + scoring.** Nothing generates opportunities and scores them on
   `desirability / feasibility / cost / risk / evidence / permission`. Ting only executes
   externally-given tickets.
4. **Project Portfolio.** Self-authored projects (proposed/active/dormant/done) born from
   opportunities. Ting Sagas are human-created and code-only.
5. **Self Model + unified Trust/Autonomy Policy.** Capabilities are reconstructed at
   startup (ephemeral); gates are scattered across three services. No single ladder
   (`observe → draft → build → test → deploy → mutate → spend → purchase`) per
   action-class/tool that *ratchets up with demonstrated trust*.
6. **Managed Tools (embodied) + experiment loop.** No abstraction for a stateful machine
   with constraints, health, per-action autonomy, feedback channels, a skill model, a
   safety contract, and an Experiment/Inspection/Improvement loop.

Everything new is **additive** and composes the existing primitives. No rewrites — same
philosophy as the autonomy-ladder plan (each level additive).

### 4.1 The Realm aggregate (new)

A long-lived stewardship context. Minimal structured row; the *soul* lives in Mimir.

```
realms(
  id uuid, slug text, name text,
  sleipnir_domain text,         -- code|infrastructure|home|business|personal
  charter_page_path text,       -- e.g. realms/kanuck-valley-models/charter.md
  mesh_realm_id text,           -- unify with RavnIdentity.realm_id (shared trust boundary)
  autonomy_profile text,        -- conservative|balanced|trusted (defaults for the ladder)
  steward_persona text,         -- which ravn persona runs the loop
  owner_id text, instance_id text, created_at timestamptz
)
```

A Realm wires together: a **charter** (Mimir), a **Mimir namespace** (`realms/<slug>/…`),
a **Sleipnir domain** for event filtering, a **mesh realm_id** (so co-stewards share a
trust boundary), an **autonomy profile**, and a **steward persona**.

### 4.2 The Charter — seed, not cage (Mimir page, new `type: charter`)

One Mimir page with two zones, reusing the existing Compiled-Truth/Timeline format:

- **Explicit zone (sacred / human-only / locked).** The 3-line seed. The steward may
  *never* edit it. Enforced by a Mimir lint rule (new `L13: charter explicit zone
  immutable`, hash-checked like the existing `L09` timeline-tamper guard).
- **Compiled Truth (machine-authored).** The inferred domain model: cared-about
  outcomes, current capabilities, current gaps, working hypotheses — all with
  `confidence` and typed edges to evidence pages.
- **Timeline (machine-authored, append-only).** Why the model changed — *the journal of
  belief changes*, which Mimir already gives us for free via `POST /mimir/page/revise`.

### 4.3 World Model & Self Model (Mimir + a thin Self registry)

- **World Model** = Mimir pages under `realms/<slug>/` using existing + new `type`s:
  `entity`, `observation`, `goal`, `decision`, plus new `opportunity`, `capability`,
  `open_question`, `experiment`, `managed_tool`. We get hybrid retrieval (P@5 ≈ 0.98),
  typed-edge traversal (`GET /mimir/related`), confidence, evidence/freshness, and the
  reflex injection **for free**.
- **Self Model** = the **Capability Ledger** (§4.7): a persisted, queryable projection of
  "what I can do / cannot do / may do / must ask," replacing today's ephemeral
  startup-time reconstruction. Each capability links to its Mimir narrative page and to a
  trust-grant row.

### 4.4 The Drive — the missing primitive (NEW · the heart)

This is the one thing that does not exist today and the reason the system would otherwise
stay a poked tool. The drive is a **continuous control loop** — always running, never
waiting to be invoked — that turns the gap between *what the realm should be* and *what it
is* into self-initiated action. It is the operator's `Curiosity → Belief → Verification →
Action`, **not** `Fixed Config → Behavior`, and emphatically **not a scheduler**.

The loop runs forever, modulated by arousal/wakefulness — never gated by a clock:

1. **Perceive (streaming).** Subscribe to the world — Sleipnir events (push, not polled),
   Mimir belief changes, managed-tool state — and keep a live picture of the realm's current
   state. The world pushes; the drive is always listening.
2. **Appraise → tension.** For each cared-about outcome (charter + learned model),
   continuously estimate satisfaction and compute the **discrepancy** (desired − perceived).
   That discrepancy is a standing *tension* signal — a homeostatic error, like a thermostat's
   — present whether or not anything just happened. Detect opportunities (a change that could
   advance a concern) and threats (one that endangers it).
3. **Attend → salience.** Aggregate tension × opportunity × novelty into a salience
   landscape: *what matters most right now*. This is the live blackboard (wire the dormant
   `SharedContext`), and it is also what decides whether anything ever reaches the human.
4. **Act when the pull is strong enough.** When a concern's salience crosses an
   action-readiness threshold *and* resources/budget/trust permit, the drive **forms an
   intention on its own** and pursues it through the body (§4.6) — the agent loop, tools,
   managed tools, gated inline (§4.7). No external poke; the pull is internal.
5. **Rest / dream / imagine when quiet.** Low external salience does **not** mean
   idle-waiting. The drive turns inward: consolidate beliefs, and run **imagination** —
   counterfactual generation against the charter ("what could exist here that doesn't yet?")
   — to manufacture its own opportunities. It explores when the world is quiet, the way a
   person does. Self-chosen from internal state, not a `dream_cycle` cron.

**The inversion from today.** The existing `DriveLoop` is a long-running daemon whose
*action* is sourced by triggers enqueuing tasks (verified). We keep the daemon shell and its
executor as the **body's runner**, but invert the source of action: **triggers/events become
perception inputs to appraisal, not commands to execute.** A Sleipnir event no longer
enqueues "do task X"; it updates the world-model, which changes the tension landscape, which
*the drive* may or may not act on. The decision to act is intrinsic.

**Stewardship modes** (steward / entrepreneur / craft / imagine / capability-hunger) are not
pipeline stages and not personas — they are **biases on the appraise + imagine steps** (which
concerns to weight, what kinds of opportunity to generate), shifted by a config weight
schedule and by arousal state. The dormant `valkyrie_evolution` (capability-hunger → learned
tools) and `PatternExtractor` become *inputs to appraisal*, not cron jobs.

**Layering — continuous will, discrete body.** The *will* (this loop) is continuous and
self-driven. The *body* it acts through (an LLM agent turn, a tool call) is necessarily
discrete — you cannot make an LLM "continuous," and that's fine: the drive is the organism;
an agent turn is how it moves a muscle. The continuity lives in the drive, not the model call.

Output of a drive cycle is **not** code — it's an updated tension/salience landscape,
**scored opportunities written to the ledger + Mimir**, and (when salience + trust cross the
bar) self-initiated projects.

### 4.5 The Opportunity Ledger (new)

Structured + queryable (Postgres) for ranking; narrative + evidence in Mimir.

```
opportunities(
  id uuid, realm_id uuid, title text, mode text,     -- steward|entrepreneur|craft|imagine|capability
  desirability real, feasibility real, cost_estimate real, risk real,
  evidence_refs text[],          -- mimir page paths / source ids
  permission_level text,         -- act|propose (from Trust Policy)
  score real,                    -- derived; weights in config (no magic numbers)
  status text,                   -- proposed|accepted|dismissed|promoted|stale
  mimir_page_path text, created_at timestamptz, updated_at timestamptz
)
```

Every imagined idea passes the **grounding filter** before it survives:
`desirability` (helps the realm?), `feasibility` (do I have the tools? → checked against
the Self Model), `cost` (→ Bifrost estimate), `risk` (can it break things?), `evidence`
(why do I believe this — links to beliefs), `permission` (→ Trust Policy: act vs
propose). Low-scoring ideas are dismissed, not spammed. This is "imagination, but
grounded."

### 4.6 The Project Portfolio (new) + execution delegation (reuse)

A **Project** is a promoted opportunity with a lifecycle. The steward *creates its own
projects* — the core "projects born from care, not given as tasks" capability.

```
projects(
  id uuid, realm_id uuid, opportunity_id uuid, title text, intent text,
  status text,                   -- proposed|active|dormant|done|abandoned
  executor_kind text,            -- ting_saga|volundr_session|ravn_flock|managed_tool|manual
  executor_ref text,             -- saga id / session id / experiment thread
  mimir_page_path text, created_at timestamptz, updated_at timestamptz
)
```

A Project is **pursued by the agent loop**, not run through a pre-authored pipeline. The
steward works a project the way the operator described the inventory chain — *"I built v1…
then I noticed X… so I researched Y… so I built Z"* — each step emerging from the last. An
`ExecutorPort` only chooses **where that loop runs** and what tools it has:

- `SessionExecutor` (default) — the steward runs the work in a Ravn/Volundr **agent
  session** with the right tools (code, web, image-gen, Mimir, managed tools) and inline
  permission gates. This covers code, research, docs, and craft alike — the loop adapts as
  it goes.
- `TingWorkflowExecutor` (optional) — *only* when a slice of work is genuinely a
  repeatable, pre-shaped pipeline (e.g. "spec → coder → reviewer → merge") does the steward
  delegate it to a Ting **workflow** via REST/PAT and await the outcome event. A backend
  choice for one bounded job, **not** the shape of the project.
- `ManagedToolExecutor` — physical/embodied work (§4.8): the agent loop closing on real
  hardware feedback. No DAG — the agent calls slice/print/observe/inspect tools and adapts.

### 4.7 The Capability Ledger + unified Trust/Autonomy Policy (new)

**Capability Ledger** — persisted Self Model:

```
capabilities(
  id uuid, realm_id uuid, name text,
  kind text,                     -- tool|skill|managed_tool|persona|integration
  status text,                   -- present|gap|building
  trust_level int,               -- current ladder rung for this capability
  mimir_page_path text, notes text
)
```

A `status='gap'` capability auto-spawns a `capability-hunger` opportunity ("I keep
wanting to inspect STL files → build an STL analysis tool"). This is the dormant
`resident_learning` flow, now connected to the ledger.

**Trust / Autonomy Policy** — one ladder, consulted before any gated action, generalizing
the autonomy-ladder note (L0 observe → L5 self-modify):

```
trust_grants(
  id uuid, realm_id uuid,
  action_class text,             -- observe|draft|build|test|deploy|mutate|spend|purchase
  target text,                   -- '*' | tool name | managed_tool id | sleipnir domain
  level int,                     -- 0..5
  limits jsonb,                  -- e.g. {max_print_time_hours:3, max_material_grams:80, allowed_materials:[PLA]}
  granted_by text, granted_at timestamptz
)
```

The gate is enforced **inline, at the moment the agent tries an action** — reusing Ravn's
`PermissionEnforcer` (`allow` / `deny` / **`ask`**) + `ApprovalMemory` + the `ask_user`
tool. There is no pre-placed gate node; the action itself is intercepted. The policy maps
each action-class to a permission verdict that **graduates with earned trust**:
- `observe` / `draft` → `allow` (always autonomous).
- `build` / `mutate` (filesystem, code) → `allow` within the workspace via permission mode.
- `deploy` (merge / publish) → `ask` until trusted, then `allow`.
- `spend` / `purchase` → `ask` **and** a hard **Bifrost** `BudgetGuardrail`/`Quota` cap
  checked at call time (the cap holds even when the verdict is `allow`).
- physical actions (`start_print`) → `ask` until trusted; **auto-cancel** stays autonomous
  on failure detectors (§4.8).

Autonomy **graduates** per capability: a run of clean outcomes (and, for managed tools,
successful experiment verdicts) flips an action from `ask` to `allow`; a failure or human
rejection flips it back. The `autonomy_profile` on the Realm sets the starting verdicts.
*The legacy Ting `ReviewEngine` confidence machinery is intentionally **not** in this path.*

### 4.8 Managed Tools — the 3D printer (new, the biggest piece)

A `ManagedTool` is a *relationship*, not a function call. New port + dynamic adapters
(per `.claude/rules/dynamic-adapters.md`: config carries `adapter:` + kwargs).

```
managed_tools(
  id uuid, realm_id uuid, name text,
  kind text,                     -- physical_machine|service|sensor
  adapter text,                  -- e.g. volundr.adapters.printers.BambuAdapter
  config jsonb,                  -- kwargs (host, serial, api key ref)
  capabilities jsonb,            -- [print PLA, report telemetry, stream camera]
  constraints jsonb,             -- build_volume, nozzle, filament_loaded, temp_range
  state jsonb, health text, last_seen timestamptz,
  safety_contract jsonb          -- per-action autonomy + auto_cancel_on triggers
)
```

```python
# src/ravn/ports/managed_tool.py  (sketch)
class ManagedToolPort(ABC):
    async def describe(self) -> ManagedToolSpec: ...        # capabilities + constraints
    async def get_state(self) -> ManagedToolState: ...      # idle/printing/error, temps, filament
    async def prepare(self, job: Job) -> PreparedJob: ...   # slice/estimate — autonomous
    async def estimate(self, job: PreparedJob) -> Estimate: ... # time/material/cost/risk
    async def start(self, job: PreparedJob) -> RunHandle: ...   # GATED
    async def observe(self, run: RunHandle) -> Feedback: ...    # telemetry + camera frame
    async def cancel(self, run: RunHandle) -> None: ...         # autonomous on failure
```

**Cybernetic loop** (the magic = feedback):

```
design/variant → validate mesh → slice → estimate(cost/time/risk)
  → [Trust gate: start_print] → start → observe(camera+telemetry)
  → inspect(expected vs actual)  → record Experiment → update beliefs(Mimir)
  → improve(orientation/temp/retraction) → retry
```

Supporting new records:

```
experiments(
  id uuid, realm_id uuid, project_id uuid, managed_tool_id uuid,
  hypothesis text, params jsonb, expected jsonb, observed jsonb,
  verdict text,                  -- success|partial|fail
  mimir_page_path text, created_at timestamptz
)
```

- **Experiment Ledger** = `experiments` rows + a Mimir `type: experiment` page (narrative
  + photos + what changed). "I lowered temp 5°C, increased retraction; stringing gone" is
  a *belief revision* on the model's printable-variant page.
- **Inspection Loop** = `observe()` feedback compared to `estimate()` expectation;
  failure detectors (`spaghetti_detected`, `thermal_anomaly`, `layer_shift`,
  `bed_adhesion_failure`) come from the adapter and trip `cancel()` autonomously.
- **Improvement Loop** = adjust params/orientation/process or, if a capability is missing
  (e.g. "I have telemetry but no visual QA"), emit a `capability-hunger` opportunity to
  *build the missing tool* — same drive loop, grounded in a real affordance.

**It's the agent loop closing on real feedback — not a DAG.** The steward runs this as one
continuous agent loop: it calls the design/slice/estimate tools, the permission layer gates
`start_print` (`ask` until trusted), it `observe`s telemetry + a camera frame, `inspect`s
expected-vs-actual, writes the result to the Experiment Ledger + revises beliefs in Mimir,
then **decides** — adjust orientation/temp/retraction and call the tools again, or stop.
"Try again" is just the next turn of the loop with new parameters; there is no graph and no
re-launch. This is the operator's *"I can practice."* Failure detectors
(`spaghetti_detected`, `thermal_anomaly`, `layer_shift`, `bed_adhesion_failure`) trip
`cancel()` autonomously regardless of trust level.

**Transport reuse:** managed-tool adapters can wrap **MCP servers** (`MCPManager` already
supports stdio/sse/http) where a printer exposes one (e.g. an OctoPrint/Bambu MCP), so
"connect a printer" is often "register an MCP server + a thin adapter," not bespoke
plumbing.

### 4.9 Domain Discovery Loop (bootstrap, new)

On realm creation from the seed, the steward runs a one-time discovery pass (then the
ongoing drive loop maintains it):

```
seed → infer likely domain map (LLM, grounded in "common patterns for a {domain}")
     → inspect available systems (repos, MCP servers, managed tools, files)
     → research adjacent patterns (web search)
     → form hypotheses (write low-confidence beliefs to Mimir)
     → verify cheaply (read-only inspections)
     → write open_questions, surface only the top few at PRESENT tier
     → update the charter Compiled-Truth zone
```

Hypotheses are written at `confidence: low` and marked clearly as inferred, never as
commandments — exactly "rough frame, look around, revise."

### 4.10 Surfacing & the Morning Brief (reuse OutputMode + Sleipnir)

- Routine work runs at `SILENT`/`AMBIENT`. Proposals needing a human run at `PRESENT`.
  Safety/budget stops run at `URGENT`. (All already in `OutputMode` + Sleipnir
  `urgency`.)
- A scheduled `morning-brief` steward task summarizes the journal: *what I did, what I
  learned, what I want to try next, and the ≤3 questions I actually need answered*. This
  is the felt "I am becoming the keeper of this company" surface.

---

### 4.11 Addressable agents and capability discovery

The steward must discover callable agents through the principal-aware Observatory Agent
Directory, not from a static agent list. Directory entries project the existing topology and
link back through `topologyNodeId`; skills and tags provide capability search, while owner,
tenant, Environment membership, and visibility constrain what the steward may see. Cross-realm
or cross-cluster discovery uses Guild's partial-result aggregate and retains source provenance.
Only equivalent, signed Agent Cards may collapse into one canonical identity. Operational and
protocol details live in [A2A Agent Directory](../operator/a2a-agent-directory.md).

## 5. Data, events, config, boundaries

- **Postgres** (raw SQL + asyncpg, **no ORM** — `.claude/rules/database.md`):
  `realms`, `opportunities`, `projects`, `capabilities`, `managed_tools`, `experiments`,
  `trust_grants`. Migrations in **both** `migrations/` and the Helm configmap
  (`.claude/rules/migrations.md`), idempotent, `NNNNNN_*.up/down.sql`.
- **Mimir** new page types: `charter`, `opportunity`, `capability`, `open_question`,
  `experiment`, `managed_tool`; new namespace `realms/<slug>/`; new lint rule `L13`
  (charter explicit-zone immutable). Belief revision + evidence/freshness already exist.
- **Sleipnir** new event types under existing namespaces (`namespace.domain.action`):
  `valkyrie.<domain>.realm_created`, `valkyrie.<domain>.opportunity_scored`,
  `valkyrie.<domain>.project_proposed`, `valkyrie.<domain>.experiment_completed`,
  `valkyrie.<domain>.belief_revised`, `valkyrie.<domain>.capability_gap_detected`. Add
  typed payloads + factories in `src/sleipnir/domain/catalog.py`.
- **Config** (no magic numbers — `.claude/rules/no-magic-numbers.md`): drive cadence,
  mode weights, max opportunities/cycle, score weights, autonomy-profile default rungs,
  managed-tool limits, morning-brief schedule — all in config with sensible defaults.
- **Module boundaries** (`.claude/rules/module-boundaries.md`): steward domain lives in
  **ravn** (it *is* a resident ravn daemon; extends `valkyrie_evolution/`). Cross-package
  needs go through **niuu** shared models + **Sleipnir** events. The steward reaches Ting
  via Ting's **REST API (PAT)**, never a Python import — and *only* when delegating a
  discrete, repeatable code campaign as a Ting **workflow**; the steward's own loop runs
  in-process (`RavnAgent`) and is **not** a workflow. Persistence behind a port
  (`StewardStorePort`) with Postgres (prod) + SQLite (local) adapters — mirrors the
  existing memory-adapter pattern.
- **Testing** (`.claude/rules/testing.md`): 85% gate, test against ports, mock asyncpg,
  zero pytest warnings. New ports get fake adapters for unit tests.

## 6. Phased plan (aligned to the autonomy ladder)

Each phase is independently shippable and additive — no rewrites. Maps to the existing
autonomy-ladder note (L0 observe … L5 self-modify).

### Phase 0 — Realm, Charter & a minimal **drive** · *L0: perceive / appraise / surface only*
- `realms` table + `Realm` model + `StewardStorePort`; `type: charter` Mimir page +
  `realms/<slug>/` namespace + `L13` immutability lint.
- The first slice of the **drive** (§4.4): a continuously-running loop that perceives realm
  state (Mimir + the Sleipnir stream), appraises it against the charter's cared-about
  outcomes, holds a live tension/salience landscape, and surfaces only the top concern.
  Discovery (infer the initial model; write low-confidence beliefs + ranked open questions)
  is the drive's **first act**, not a one-shot script.
- No execution, no autonomy — it can perceive, appraise, and surface, nothing else.
- **Deliverable:** operator gives a 3-line seed and the steward *comes alive* — it builds an
  inferred model, holds its own sense of what's most off in the realm, and brings you the
  highest-tension concern + a brief. The point is that it is **self-driven from second one**,
  not that it ran a task. *This is "you name the realm, and it wakes up in the territory."*

### Phase 1 — Drive Loop & Opportunity Ledger · *L0–L1: propose / draft*
- `StewardDriveTrigger` + stewardship modes; subscribe to `signal.*`/`environment.*`.
- `opportunities` table + scoring (d/f/c/r/e/p) + grounding filter.
- Wire dormant `PatternExtractor` and `resident_learning` capability-hunger.
- **Deliverable:** the steward continuously proposes **scored** opportunities and refines
  beliefs; daily brief shows "what changed, what I'd try, what I need from you." Still
  propose-only.

### Phase 2 — Project Portfolio & agent-loop execution · *L1–L2: build/test auto, deploy gated*
- `projects` table + `ExecutorPort`; the default `SessionExecutor` runs a project as an
  **emergent Ravn agent loop** with tools + Mimir + inline permission gates.
  `TingWorkflowExecutor` is available only for the rare pre-shaped pipeline.
- The deploy gate is **inline**: the agent's merge/publish action is intercepted by the
  permission layer (`ask`) — not a graph node, not a confidence threshold.
- **Deliverable:** "build inventory v1" goes idea → PR via the agent loop (each step
  emerging from the last); **merge** pauses to ask at the action. The first real "executed
  because it cared" loop.

### Phase 3 — Trust/Autonomy Policy engine · *inline gates, enable graduation*
- `trust_grants` + `capabilities` (Self Model). The policy maps each action-class to an
  **inline permission verdict** (`allow`/`ask`/`deny`) enforced by Ravn's
  `PermissionEnforcer` at tool-call time. `spend`/`purchase` also honor a hard **Bifrost**
  budget cap; `build`/`mutate` honor **Ravn** permission modes.
- Autonomy **graduates** per action: clean outcomes + experiment verdicts flip
  `ask`→`allow`; a failure or rejection flips it back. `autonomy_profile` presets the
  starting verdicts.
- **Deliverable:** one coherent trust ladder enforced inline at the action; the steward
  acts freely where it has *earned* trust, pauses to ask where it hasn't.

### Phase 4 — Managed Tools (embodied) · *L3–L4: prepare auto, start gated → unattended-in-policy*
- `ManagedToolPort` + `managed_tools` + first adapter (OctoPrint/Bambu, MCP-backed where
  possible) + `experiments` + Inspection/Improvement loops + auto-cancel detectors.
- **Deliverable:** design → slice → estimate → (approve first print) → print → inspect →
  iterate; later, overnight test prints within `safety_contract` limits.

### Phase 5 — Capability hunger & self-extension · *L5: modify the toolchain*
- Capability gaps (incl. managed-tool gaps like "no visual QA") auto-become tool-building
  projects; learned tools persist; the steward expands its own affordances.
- **Deliverable:** "I keep wanting visual QA → I built an inspection pipeline" end-to-end.

## 7. The smallest first slice (build this first to feel the magic)

Within Phase 0, the minimum that produces the *resident-keeper* feeling:

1. `realms` row + `charter` Mimir page (seed in the sacred zone).
2. A one-shot **Domain Discovery** run (a single steward `AgentTask`) that, given the
   seed, writes ~6–10 low-confidence belief pages + a ranked `open_questions` page under
   `realms/<slug>/`, using existing `mimir_write` and web search.
3. A **morning brief** rendered from those pages at `PRESENT` tier.

No new execution, no managed tools, no autonomy. Just: *name the realm → it inspects,
infers, and reports back what it now believes and what it needs to know.* That validates
the whole reframe before we invest in execution and embodiment.

---

## 8. Design principles / risks

- **Seed stays tiny; everything else self-authored.** The only files a human touches are
  the charter explicit zone and (rarely) the autonomy profile.
- **Imagination must be grounded.** The 6-axis scoring filter is the anti-spam mechanism;
  ideas that fail feasibility/evidence are dismissed, not surfaced.
- **Reuse the gates we trust.** Don't reimplement budget/review — delegate `spend` to
  Bifrost and `deploy` to Ting so safety is enforced by code already in production.
- **Belief humility.** Inferred beliefs are `confidence: low` and clearly inferred;
  revisions are journaled forever (Mimir), so the steward can be wrong and learn.
- **Physical safety is first-class.** `start_print` is gated until trust is earned;
  failure detectors cancel autonomously; `safety_contract` limits are hard caps.
- **Additive only.** Every phase composes existing primitives; nothing above requires
  rewriting ravn/ting/volundr/mimir.
```
